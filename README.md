- herbs.tsv comes from here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A0OiwivgWFHHFZ70CH3anqwEb9Qw4sC4ryjc1Hf_wEw/edit#gid=0
- Basic initial structure is one tsv, herbs. Later will add treatments and ailments.
- Basic goal is we glean data from http://alternativehealing.org/ and organize it into a few spreadsheets and make ~3 pages to display everything, instead of ~2000 pages 
- Once we settle on a schema, I can write a scraper that will get most of the herb info out of the site and into the spreadsheet. Ailments and formulas are less structured and will probably be somewhat manual.
