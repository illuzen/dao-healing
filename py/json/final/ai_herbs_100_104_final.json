            "Inhibits the growth of prostate cells: In vitro studies showed that the lignan of the ya ma ren (flax seed) can inhibit the growth of the cells of the prostate gland itself",
            "Flax Seeds are the highest dietary source of lignan, containing 75 times the amount compared to the plant with the next highest source of plant lignan. The majority of the plant lignan component of flax seeds is located in the outer husk of the seed"
        ],
        "Dosage": "15 ~ 30 grams per day\n1½ - 3 heaping tablespoons (15 to 30g) per day.\nOne tablespoon (20 ml or ~ 10 g) of flax seeds contains 4 grams of a-linolenic acid and 4 grams of mucilage.",
        "Samples of Formulae": "For high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL): ya ma root 50 g. Make into decoction. Take it every day for 4 weeks. The LDL may lower 8%.",
        "Contraindications": "Omega-3 is a highly unstable fat and can become rancid quickly and carcinogenic. Do not use flax seed oil for deep fat frying because omega-3 cannot stand high heat. Store flax seed and flax oil in black container and refrigerate. Discard seeds or oil that smells fishy or rancid, because that signals toxicity.\nSeed should be washed before using to avoid the mold Aspergillus niger (toxic for the respiration system) and Aspergillus flavus (toxic for the liver). These molds are commonly found in grains and are extremely toxic.\nLinamarin, after hydrolysis, can release free hydrogen cyanide acid, which can suffocate and poison the cells.",
        "Research": "A diet rich in flax seed seems to reduce the size, aggressiveness and severity of tumors in mice that have been genetically engineered to develop prostate cancer, according to new research from Duke University Medical Center. And in 3 percent of the mice the flax seed diet kept them from getting the disease at all. (From news release issued by Duke University Medical Center).",
        "Notes": "Seed must be ground for consumption because of the tough seed coat that is indigestible. The ground-up seeds should be taken with water since the mucilage absorbs 5 times the weight of the seed.\nIt is not advisable to use flax seed in baked food since the fatty acid omega-3 cannot withstand high heat and can become carcinogenic.",

The LDL may lower 8%.\n\n低密度胆固醇過高﹕亞麻根50克。煎湯。連續四周可\n            使低密度胆固醇 (LDL) 降低8%。\n\n\n\n\n\nModern Research:\n\n現代研究﹕\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCautions:\n\n禁忌﹕\n\n\n\nOmega-3 is a highly unstable \n            fat and can become rancid quickly and become carcinogenic. Do not use \n            flax seed oil for deep fat frying because omega-3 cannot stand high \n            heat. Store flax seed and flax oil in black container and refrigerate. \n            Discard seed or oil that smells fishy or rancid, because that smell \n            signals toxicity.\n\nSeed should be washed before \n            using to avoid the mold , Aspergillus niger,  which is toxic \n            for the respiration system and the mold , Aspergillus flavus,  \n            which is toxic for the liver.  These molds are commonly found in \n            grains and are extremely toxic.\n\n\n\n\n        　\n\n\nLinamarin, after hydrolysis, can release free hydrogen \n        cyanide acid, which can suffocate and poison the cells.\n\n亞麻苦甙（linamarin） ，經水解後可析出游\n        離態的氢氰酸，致組織细胞窒息中毒。\n \n\nA diet rich in flax seed seems to reduce the size, aggressiveness and severity \n        of tumors in mice that have been genetically engineered to develop prostate \n        cancer, according to new research from Duke University Medical Center. And \n        in 3 percent of the mice the flax seed diet kept them from getting the disease \n        at all.

It is collected during summer and autumn. Lei gong teng is a deciduous climbing vine growing to 12 meters,  with brown, angular, downy twigs. The leaves are light green, smooth on top, and pale gray with light hairs underneath.  They have crenate margins and pointed apexes,  and are ovate to elliptic, 5-15 cm long, 2.5 - 7 cm wide. The scented hermaphroditic (having male and female organs) flowers are small and whitish with five petals and are about 9 mm across. The fruit is 3-winged, and brownish red, about 1.5 cm long.The plant can grow in light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. It can survive in acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soil.  It can grow in semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It requires moist soil.Pharmaceutical name:英文药名： Radix Tripterygium wilfordiiBiological name:拉丁學名： Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f.Pron.in Japanese:日語發音：taiwankurozuruPron. in Korean:韓語發音：Mi-yeok-jul-na-muPron. in Cantonese粤語發音：leoi4 gung1 tang4Common Name:英文名： three-wing-nutFolk Name:民間名稱：\"Walk Seven Steps and Die\" , \"Intestine Breaking Plant\"七步倒，斷腸草。Distribution:分佈：native of southern part of mainland China, Taiwan, Burma原産於中國南部，臺灣，缅甸。Properties (characteristics):性味：bitter and very toxic苦，劇毒。Actions & Indications:主治：　for: anti-inflammation,  kills worms, resolves toxins, treating proteinuric renal disease, used as immunosuppressive agent on autoimmune diseases.抗炎，殺蟲，消毒，治蛋白尿腎臟病，於免疫系统病以抑制免疫系统。Chemical ingredients:化學成份：　　1.
