        "Research": "1. On Acute Cerebral Infarction 2. Effect on Pulse Wave Velocity 3. Garlic Supplements Can Impede HIV Medication 4. Effect on E. coli 5. Fighting Chronic Lung Infections in Cystic Fibrosis Patients: Garlic has been shown to inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most common causes of chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. It works by disrupting a bacterial communication system called quorum sensing, which enables bacteria to form biofilms—tenacious colonies of bacteria that persist in the lungs. Quorum sensing molecules also activate bacterial virulence factors such as elastase, an enzyme that breaks down elastic tissue in the lungs. This research was led by Alan Smyth, from the School of Human Development at the University of Nottingham.",
        "Notes": "Single clove garlic (garlic onion) is produced by planting an immature garlic clove or unfavorable planting conditions. Yunan province of China is a major producer of single clove garlic. Historical records indicate that Zhang Qian brought garlic back to the Central Plains during his diplomatic missions to the Western Regions. Zhang Qian (164 BCE – 114 BCE) was a native of Chenggu in Hanzhong Commandery (present-day Chenggu County, Shaanxi Province). In the second year of the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (139 BCE), the imperial court recruited envoys to the Western Regions, and Zhang Qian volunteered for the mission in his capacity as a court officer (langguan). Some of the sulfur-containing compounds and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) present in garlic can enhance the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), thereby promoting vasodilation (relaxation of blood vessels).\n Lipid- and Blood Sugar-Lowering Effects: Garlic extract has been shown to significantly reduce blood lipids and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in rabbits with hyperlipidemia, while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL). It also reduces lipid accumulation in the aorta by 72% and markedly shrinks atherosclerotic plaques, showing better results than Clofibrate (also known as Clofibric acid, Atromid-S, or Antuoming). Garlic essential oil has proven effective in combating elevated blood lipids, helping maintain normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels in both serum and liver. This effect may be related to the reduction of cholesterol esterification in the bloodstream. Additionally, garlic influences liver glycogen synthesis and raises plasma insulin levels, offering significant therapeutic benefits for diabetic patients. \n Cardiovascular Effects: A number of recent animal studies and clinical trials consistently demonstrate that garlic—particularly its active compound, allicin—has a significant antihypertensive effect. It improves microcirculation, increases peripheral blood flow, and enhances the activity of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which promotes fibrinolysis. Garlic also inhibits the activity of clotting factors, lowers plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and exhibits strong anti-atherosclerotic properties. Additionally, garlic essential oil provides protective benefits against aortic atherosclerosis caused by hypercholesterolemia. \n Antimicrobial Effects: Garlic is often referred to as a natural antibiotic due to its broad-spectrum activity against various pathogenic microorganisms. It can effectively kill or inhibit Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Shigella, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholerae, among others—without leading to drug resistance. The most potent antimicrobial agents in garlic are allicin and its essential oil components with a refractive index above 1.57. Garlic extracts also show varying degrees of inhibitory effects on common pathogenic skin fungi. Some researchers suggest that its antimicrobial activity is partly due to a non-volatile, oily compound with antibiotic-like properties. Moreover, garlic exhibits a strong inhibitory effect against cytomegalovirus (CMV), with its potency increasing proportionally to concentration. \n Anti-Aging Effects: Some studies have compared the medicinal properties of garlic and ginseng, particularly in their antioxidant capacity. In vitro experiments have shown that alliin and ethanol extracts of garlic exhibit stronger antioxidant activity than ginseng. In vivo, garlic demonstrated superior inhibition of superoxide dismutase activity in the liver, although its antioxidant performance in the brain was slightly lower than that of ginseng. These findings suggest that garlic may play a meaningful role in delaying the aging process. \n Immune Function: Research indicates that allicin can induce the transformation of human lymphocytes. Natural garlic extract has been shown to promote T-lymphocyte activation and enhance the functional activity of both macrophages and lymphocytes. As a result, garlic contributes to the strengthening of the immune system. \n Anti-Platelet Aggregation Effect: Consumption of allicin has been shown to significantly reduce platelet adhesion rates and noticeably prolong blood clotting time in animal studies. Garlic essential oil also exhibits thrombolytic properties and effectively inhibits platelet aggregation, contributing to improved circulatory health. \n Anti-Tumor Effects: Recent studies have shown that oral intake of garlic oil can inhibit the development of skin cancer induced by chemical carcinogens such as benzo(a)pyrene. This effect may be achieved by suppressing the activation of the aryl hydroxylase enzyme system during the initiation stage of carcinogenesis, thereby blocking the mutagenic transformation of normal cells. Research also indicates that garlic interferes with pre-cancerous liver conditions caused by nitrosamines. Garlic oil supports the normal division and repair of cellular DNA, and its absence may lead to DNA abnormalities, increasing the risk of cancers such as lung, liver, and esophageal cancer. Additionally, garlic oil enhances the number of neutrophils and macrophages, strengthening the immune defense. Consuming raw garlic can inhibit nitrate-reducing bacteria in the stomach, thereby reducing the nitrites formed by bacterial activity. Two critical anti-cancer compounds in garlic—diallyl sulfide and calcium salts—help prevent carcinogen formation, disrupt carcinogen activation, boost detoxification, and eliminate reactive metabolites. These actions, combined with garlic’s ability to stimulate immune responses, block peroxide generation, and inhibit abnormal cell proliferation, contribute to the prevention and suppression of tumor development. \n Detoxification Effects: Recent studies have explored the use of garlic in treating heavy metal poisoning. In one case, administering 0.3 grams of garlic tablets orally, three times a day, achieved a 100% effective rate in treating lead poisoning. Additionally, research on changes in ATPase activity in mice exposed to mercury revealed that garlic also has a strong antagonistic effect against mercury toxicity, indicating its potential as a natural detoxifying agent. \n Other Effects: Garlic also exhibits protective properties, such as anti-radiation effects and protection of biological membranes. A 0.5% garlic solution can render Trichomonas vaginalis inactive within 5 minutes. It is also useful for the prevention and treatment of conditions such as dry periodontitis, epistaxis, colds, and chronic gastritis. Additionally, garlic extract has been shown to increase the mortality rate of Aedes mosquito larvae, and a one-millionth concentration of garlic extract can repel female mosquitoes.",
        "Chemical Ingredients": [
            "1. Evaporating Oil Components: Garlic contains a wide range of volatile sulfur compounds. These include allyl methyl sulfide, diallyl sulfide, 6-methyl-1-thio-2,4-cyclohexadiene, dimethyl sulfide, divinyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, allyl methyl disulfide, dithiocyclopentene, 5-methyl-1,2-dithio-3-cyclopentene, allyl propyl disulfide, 4-methyl-1,2-dithio-3-cyclopentene, 3-vinyl-1,2-dithio-4-cyclohexene, 3-vinyl-1,2-dithio-5-cyclohexene, dimethyl trisulfide, allyl methyl trisulfide, 4-vinyl-1,2,3-trithio-5-cyclohexene, diallyl trisulfide, allyl propyl trisulfide, diallyl tetrasulfide, dipropyl disulfide, methyl propyl trisulfide, allyl methyl tetrasulfide, and allyl methyl pentasulfide. Additionally, garlic oil contains non-sulfur compounds like allicin, sulfur dioxide, 2-hydroxy-propyl, cymene, trans-ajoene, cis-ajoene, 2-vinyl-4-H-1,3-dithiin, and 3-vinyl-4-H-1,2-dithiin.",
            "2. Carbohydrates: The carbohydrate content of garlic includes simple sugars such as glucose, fructose, galactose, sucrose, and raffinose. It also contains starch, garlic dextrin, and garlic sugar. Four key types of polysaccharides are found: D-galactan, D-fructan, D-glucan, and D-arabinan. From garlic, five specific polysaccharides have been isolated and identified as GF-1, GF-II, GF-III, GF-IVa, and GF-IV.",
            "3. Peptides and Amino Acids: Garlic is rich in amino acids, notably those with higher concentrations like cysteine, histidine, and lysine. One of the key sulfur-containing amino acids found is alliin, also known as S-allyl-cysteine sulfoxide. When garlic is enzymatically hydrolyzed, alliin is converted into allicin, the compound responsible for garlic’s distinctive aroma and antimicrobial properties. Six polypeptides have also been identified in garlic: A, B, C, D, E, and F.",
            "4. Enzymes:A variety of enzymes are naturally present in garlic. The most significant is alliinase, which catalyzes the transformation of alliin into allicin. Other enzymes in garlic include peroxidase, hydrolases, polyphenol oxidase, hexokinase, polyfructose glycoside hydrolase, invertase, phosphatase, pectin esterase, and trypsin. These enzymes contribute to garlic’s metabolic activities and therapeutic effects.",
            "5. 5. Glucosinolates: Garlic contains multiple glucosinolate compounds, collectively known as scordinins. Specific types that have been isolated include scordinin A2, A3, B1, B2, and B3. These compounds are known for their biological activity and may contribute to garlic’s immune-enhancing and anticancer properties.",
            "6. Steroidal Glycosides: Several steroidal glycosides have been isolated from garlic. Proeruboside B is one, with a structure identified as 26-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-22-hydroxy-25-(R)-5α-furostane-3β,6β,26-triol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→3)]-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-D-galactopyranoside. Sativoside-R1 and Sativoside-R2 (tigogenin-based) are additional glycosides that contribute to the plant’s medicinal properties, particularly in modulating cholesterol and steroidal metabolism.",
            "7. Oxalic Acid: Garlic contains oxalic acid at a concentration of 0.36 grams per 100 grams of fresh garlic. Though found in relatively low amounts, oxalic acid is an organic acid that naturally occurs in many plants and plays a role in mineral binding and bioavailability."

Garlic oil may be effective against elevated blood lipids and causes serum and liver cholesterol, triglycerides to remain at normal levels. The mechanism may be related to lower serum cholesterol esterification. Garlic can also affect the liver glycogen synthesis, increased plasma insulin levels. It is quite beneficial for diabetic patients　 　　2﹐對心血管系統的作用：近年的一系列動物實驗及臨床療效一致表明，大蒜素有顯著的降壓作用。並可改善微循環，增加外周血流量和組織纖溶蛋白溶酶原激活劑的活性，抑制凝血因子的活性，降低血漿丙二醛水平，並有明顯的抗動脈粥樣硬化作用。大蒜精油對高膽固醇血症引起的主動脈粥樣硬化具有好的保護作用。 2, Effect on cardiovascular system: numerous animal experiments and clinical efficacy results in recent years have consistently shown that garlic is known to possess a significant antihypertensive effect. It can improve microcirculation, increase peripheral blood flow and tissue plasminogen activator fibrinolytic activity, inhibit the activity of clotting factors, decrease plasma malondialdehyde levels and have significant anti-atherosclerotic effect. Garlic evaporating oil possesses good protection for hypercholesterolemia-induced aortic atherosclerosis.　　　3．抗病原微生物作用：大蒜被稱為天然抗菌素，對化膿性鏈球菌﹐金黃色葡萄球菌 ﹐腦膜炎雙球菌﹐肺炎球菌’﹐結核杆菌﹐痢疾杆菌﹐傷寒杆菌﹐大腸杆菌﹐霍亂弧菌等均有殺滅或抑制作用，且不產生耐藥性。其有效成分中大蒜素和折光率在1.57以上的大蒜精油抗菌作用最強。大蒜提取物時常見致病性皮膚真菌有不同程度的抑制作用，有研究者認為其抗菌物質中有一個類似抗微生物性質的化合物，它是非揮發油性油狀液體。另外，本品對巨細胞病毒有較好抑制作用，其效價隨濃度的提高相應增強。 　3. Antibiotic effect: Garlic is known as natural antibiotics for Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, meningococcus, pneumococcus, tuberculosis, dysentery bacillus, typhoid bacillus, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae etc. it can kill or inhibit without developing drug resistance. Its active ingredient allicin and its evaporating oil with refractive index of 1.57 or higher possess the strongest antibiotic effect. The garlic extract possesses different degree of fungicidal effect on common pathogenic skin fungi.. There are researchers believe that the antibiotic substance compound is similar to antimicrobial compound and it is non-volatile oil type of oily liquid. In addition, garlic possesses good inhibiting effect toward cytomegalovirus. Its inhibition property increases with increased concentration. 　　4﹐抗衰老作用：有人將大蒜與人參作比較。發現蒜氨酸 (alliin) 和大蒜乙醇提取物的體外抗氧化活性優於人參，在體內大蒜對肝臟抑制超氧化物歧化酸的活性亦優於人參，在腦內活性稍遜於人參，提示大蒜對延緩衰老有一定作用。 　4, Anti-aging effects: There are studies that compared the medical effect of garlic and ginseng. In vitro, alliin and garlic ethanol extract  was found to be better than ginseng in anti-oxidation activity.  In vivo, the activity of of anti superoxide dismutase acid is also superior to ginseng but activity in the brain, ginseng is a little better than garlic. These suggest that garlic have a role in delaying aging. 　　5﹐免疫作用：研究表明，大蒜素 (allicin)可誘導人淋巴細胞轉化，天然蒜液能增加T淋巴細胞轉化，增加巨噬細胞和淋巴細胞的功能活動，使免疫功能增強。 　5. Immune function: Studies have shown that allicin can induce lymphocyte transformation. Natural garlic solution can increase T lymphocyte transformation, increased functional activity of macrophages and lymphocytes。 Thus immune function is enhanced. 　　6﹐抗血小板凝聚作用：服用大蒜素(allicin)可使血小板黏附率明顯下降，明顯延長動物凝血時間。大蒜精油也具有溶栓和抗血小板凝集作用。 　6, anti-platelet aggregation effect: taking allicin allows platelet adhesion rate to decrease significantly and prolong clotting time animal. Garlic oil also has a thrombolytic and antiplatelet effect. 　　7﹐抗腫瘤作用：近年國外學者發現，口服大蒜油能抑制化學性致癌物苯並芘誘發皮膚癌的過程，可能通過抑制芳基羥化酶系統的活化，在組織癌變的啟動階段就阻斷了致癌物對正常細胞產生的誘變過程。有人研究發現，本品對 亞硝酸胺誘發肝癌前病變有明顯的干擾作用。大蒜精油能參與細胞遺傳物質DNA正常的分裂和修復過程，缺乏大蒜精油時，會使細胞DNA異常，從而為肺癌 ﹐肝癌﹐食道癌的發生創造了條件。大蒜油還有增加中性粒細胞﹐巨噬細胞數量的作用。生食大蒜能抑制胃內硝酸鹽還原菌的生長，從而使胃液中的因細菌作用而產生的亞硝酸鹽減少。大蒜中的二烯丙基硫和鈣鹽是兩種非常重要的抗癌因子，通過防止致癌物形成，干擾致癌物的活化，增強解毒性能，法除反應性代謝產物等方式，避免正常細胞向癌細胞的轉化，其所含的有效成分還可刺激免疫反應﹐阻斷過氧化物生成 ﹐抑制增生等多種方式作用於腫瘤發生的促進階段，進一步阻止腫瘤細胞的形成。 　7, Anti-tumor effect: oral garlic oil can inhibit chemical carcinogen benzopyrene-induced skin cancer in the process. It is possibly by inhibiting the activation of aryl hydroxylase system during the initiation phase of benzo(a)pyrene (BP) induced skin carcinogenesis in mice, in carcinogenesis on resistance mutagenic carcinogens process off normal cells. It was found that the product of the nitrosamines-induced liver disease before significant interference. Garlic oil can participate in the genetic material of the cell division and DNA repair process normally, the absence of garlic oil, make cell DNA abnormalities, so as lung cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer incidence create the conditions. Garlic oil also increased neutrophils, macrophages number of role. Raw garlic can inhibit the growth of nitrate-reducing bacteria in the stomach, allowing gastric nitrite produced by bacterial action to be reduced. Garlic diallyl sulfide and calcium salt are two very important anti-cancer factors, by preventing the formation of carcinogens, interference carcinogen activation, enhance detoxification performance, in addition to reactive metabolites method, etc., to prevent normal cells transformation of cancer cells, which contains the active ingredient can also stimulate an immune response, block superoxide production, suppression stage multiple ways to promote hyperplasia in tumorigenesis, and further prevent the formation of tumor cells. 　　8﹐解毒作用：新近有人試用大蒜片0.3克，每日3次口服治療鉛中毒，有效率100％。通過小鼠ATP酶變化研究大蒜對汞中毒的防治作用，亦顯示其拮抗作用良好。  　　9﹐其它：大蒜還具有抗輻射﹐保護生物膜等作用。0.5％大蒜液5分鐘後可使陰道滴虫喪失活力，本品也可用干牙周病 ﹐鼻衄﹐感冒﹐慢性胃炎等疾病的預防和治療。大蒜提取物有增加伊蚊幼虫死亡率的作用，其百萬分之一的提取液對雌蚊有驅除作用。 　http://www.chinainfo.gov.cn/data/200110/1_20011024_19500.html　Search this siteProblems with website?
