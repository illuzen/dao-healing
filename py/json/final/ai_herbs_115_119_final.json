        "Samples of Formulae": "long dan xie gan wan (Long Dan Xie Gan Pill).\nlong dan xie gan tang (Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction).\nTo treat nosebleed: blow scorched shan zhi zi (gardenia fruit) powder into the nostril until bleeding stops.\nTo resolve retention of urine: use zhi zi kernels (14 pieces), a whole garlic bulb, and a little salt; pound together and apply to the umbilicus and external genitalia. After a while, urination will be possible.\nFor painful, slow urination with blood: use fresh zhi zi (gardenia fruit) and talcum powder in equal parts, decocted in scallion soup for oral administration.\nFor diarrhea with fresh red blood: use zhi zi kernel (gardenia fruit) scorched to ash, take one spoon with water.\nFor heat toxin blood dysentery: use 14 zhi zi (gardenia fruit), peeled and pounded into powder, made into pills with honey, size of a Chinese olive; take three pills three times a day. Efficacy is significant. Can also be decocted in water and taken.\nFor obstetric bleeding at childbirth: use scorched zhi zi (gardenia fruit), ground to powder, take three qian (approx. 12 g) with rice soup. If upper burner heat, use together with the shell.\nFor edema due to heat: use scorched zhi zi (gardenia fruit), ground to powder, take three qian (approx. 12 g) with rice soup. If upper burner heat, use together with the shell.\nFor cholera with cramping, abdominal fullness, and persistent vomiting and diarrhea: use over 10 zhi zi (gardenia fruit), scorched and ground to powder, take with warm cooked wine.\nFor gastric burning pain: use large zhi zi (gardenia fruit) 7 (or 9 pieces), stir-fried to scorched, add one bowl of water, boil to 70%, then add raw ginger juice to drink; pain will cease immediately. If the illness recurs, add one qian xuan ming fen (glauber's salt/mirabilite) to stop pain.\nFor relapse of febrile disease due to dietary or sexual indiscretion: use 30 zhi zi (gardenia fruit), decoct in 3 sheng (about 600 ml) water to 1 sheng (about 200 ml), take, must produce slight sweating. \nFor childhood mania (accumulated heat in lower body, hot, delirious, not eating): use zhi zi kernel (gardenia fruit, 7 pieces), fermented soy bean (5 qian), decoct in one bowl water to 70% and take. Whether or not vomiting occurs, it is effective.\nFor constipation with heat: use 7 shan zhi zi (gardenia fruit), bore holes and roast, add appropriate amount of water, boil to half sheng, strain, add 3 qian da huang (rhubarb), take warm.\nFor wind-phlegm headache: zhi zi (gardenia fruit) powder mixed with honey, applied thickly to the tongue; induces vomiting and immediately stops pain.\nFor erysipelas with flaming fire: zhi zi (gardenia fruit) mashed and mixed with water, applied externally.\nFor tinea in brow: scorched zhi zi (gardenia fruit), ground to powder, mixed with oil, applied externally.\nFor swelling and pain from injury: zhi zi (gardenia fruit) and white flour mashed together and applied externally.\nFor burns and scalds: zhi zi (gardenia fruit) powder mixed with egg white, applied thickly.\nJiao zhi zi (scorched zhi zi: gardenia fruit baked until brown, under 200°C), has better calming property.\nJiang zhi zhi zi: zhi zi prepared with juice of ginger.",
        "Contraindications": "Contraindicated in cases of loose stool or loss of appetite due to pixu (spleen deficiency) with yangxu (yang deficiency).\nGeniposide caused diarrhea in laboratory mice.\nZhi zi is generally non-toxic to humans but can be toxic to animals such as horses, dogs, and cats.\nThose deficient in spleen and stomach qi, or weak gastrointestinal function, may experience vomiting when taking raw zhi zi.\nStir-frying zhi zi removes this adverse effect.",
        "Research": "It can lower increased liver enzyme AST caused by total ligation of bile duct in animals [1].\nGeniposide can inhibit the secretion of stomach acid.\nIt can promote the secretion of pancreatic enzyme and promote bile secretion.\nUrsolic acid has an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system.\nIt can inhibit Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria catarrhalis.\nThe decoction can kill adult Schistosoma leptospirosis. Water extract inhibits a variety of skin fungi in vitro.\nEthanol extract, water extract, ethyl acetate fraction, and geniposide have anti-inflammatory activity and can heal soft tissue injury. Ointment made from the extract can accelerate soft tissue healing.\nGeniposide at high dose may cause acute hepatotoxicity in rats, and is likely linked to oxidative stress, but at normal dose of 24.3 mg kg(-1) or less, did not cause hepatotoxicity even in repeated dosing in rats.",
        "Notes": "Raw zhi zi (gardenia fruit) is very bitter-cold, easily damages the center qi, and has a stimulating effect on the stomach. Those with weak spleen and stomach often vomit after administration. Stir-fried zhi zi can eliminate this adverse effect.\nStir-fried zhi zi and jiao zhi zi (scorched zhi zi) have similar functions. Stir-fried zhi zi retains more bitter-cold properties and is suitable when heat is more severe, while jiao zhi zi is more appropriate in patients with weak spleen and stomach. Both forms clear heat and relieve irritability, often used for heat depression with agitation, liver heat with red eyes. For diseases such as febrile agitation, pterygium, or difficulty opening eyes due to shame and pain from liver heat, use clear or focus forms as appropriate.\nCharcoal zhi zi excels at cooling blood and stopping bleeding, used for bleeding of various types such as vomiting, coughing blood, nosebleed, blood in urine, uterine bleeding, and collapse with massive blood loss. Example: Shi hui san (Ten Charcoal Powder).\nThe Japanese pronunciation kuchinashi for 山梔子 (shan zhi zi) is found in the Dictionary of Botany published by Shang Wu.",
