        "Notes": "Ru xiang is derived from the resin of Boswellia carteri and related species from the family Burseraceae.\nMainly imported, commonly used in Chinese herbal medicine, possesses the properties of activating blood, relieving pain, reducing swelling, and promoting wound healing.\nSome unscrupulous merchants adulterate with resin from other plants or starches, making them similar in appearance but with differences in properties.\nAuthentic ru xiang: nipple-shaped, teardrop-shaped, or irregular small granular pieces, 0.5–2 cm long, some agglomerate. Pale yellow or ivory white, semi-transparent, shiny, turns darker over time to brownish yellow, hard and brittle. When chewed, initially forms small fragments, then quickly softens to a gum, sticks to teeth, with a mild aromatic spicy sensation.\nFake ru xiang: oval, or clusters of variously sized near-round small particles forming irregular lumps, 0.5–1.8 cm, pale yellowish white, opaque, hard texture, granulated surface without luster. When chewed has a sandy feel, with a slight corn scent.\nPhysical identification: 1. Powder under UV (365nm) shows pale yellow fluorescence (fake: no fluorescence). 2. 90% ethanol extract under UV on filter paper: bright yellow fluorescence (fake: light yellow). 3. When boiled in water and left overnight, authentic stays emulsified and doesn’t separate (fake separates and top layer turns blue with iodine addition). 4. With acetic anhydride and concentrated sulfuric acid: authentic changes from purple-red to black-brown (fake: purple to green with undyed white precipitate). 5. Burning: authentic leaves a small amount of white ash; fake forms a black carbonaceous lump and burnt smell remains.",
