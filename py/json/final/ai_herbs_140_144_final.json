        "Research": "About a little more than 20 minutes after ingesting ban mao, the toxicity shows. The symptoms include burning sensation in the throat and mouth, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, pain in the abdomen area, frequent urination, burning sensation in the urinary tract, difficulty in urination, blood in urine, and protein in urine. In serious cases, there can be a lack of urine, inability to urinate, elevated BUN and creatinine, exhaustion of kidney function.\n\nContact with the skin or mucous membrane causes burning pain, congestion, blisters, oral erosion, ulceration, and, in prolonged cases, skin necrosis.\n\nAntidote methods as documented (not necessarily proven effective): In early stages of toxic reaction, use gastric lavage. Then, drink milk and/or liquid egg white to protect gastric mucosa or take 10ml of 10% aluminum hydroxide gel every half hour. If no abdominal pain or diarrhea, ingest 50% magnesium sulfate with caution to induce diarrhea and expel toxins. Activated charcoal or salt-type laxative can be given to lessen toxin absorption. Supplement fluid to maintain electrolyte balance. Penicillin can be injected intramuscularly to prevent infection. Address symptoms as they appear. In case of upper digestive tract bleeding, arrest the bleeding; if serious, transfuse blood. In case of uremia, use hemodialysis. If peripheral circulation fails, supplement blood and use vasodilator. Since ban mao toxin (canthavidin) is fat soluble, do not ingest oil or fat during treatment period to avoid accelerating toxin absorption. Folk therapy includes decoction of lu dou (mung bean), gan cao (licorice), hei dou (black bean), green onion, and tea leaves for detoxification and bleeding arrest. For skin contact injury, use 1% gentian violet for topical application. \n\nMethods referenced from: Yang Xingyi; Date: 2001-12-17 14:40:19.",
