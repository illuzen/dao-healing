Animal experiments show that Prunella vulgaris can delay the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta, and has good effects in lowering blood lipids and in treating coronary heart disease with arteriosclerosis.\n\nFor acute tonsillitis: Using the bitter-cold nature of Prunella vulgaris to clear heat toxins, and its pungent taste to disperse wind-heat and dissipate lumps, it is applied in the treatment of acute tonsillitis caused by wind-heat toxin clumping in the throat. Clinically, 30–60 g of Prunella vulgaris is decocted in water 2 times, the decoctions combined and consumed frequently within one day. When taking, swallow slowly to prolong the retention time of the liquid in the throat, allowing the medicine to act directly on the lesion site, achieving very good results.\n\nFor insomnia: For mental fatigue, difficulty falling asleep at night, sometimes awake all night, irritability, easy anger, susceptibility to fright and dreaming, red tongue body, fine and rapid pulse. The pattern belongs to internal disturbance of depressed fire, with yang not joining yin. The prescription uses 15 g Prunella vulgaris, 12 g Pinellia ternata, decocted in water, taken once daily, for 10 consecutive doses.\n\n For amnesia: xia ku cao 15 g, ban xia (Pinellia) 12 g, decoction. One dose daily for 10 days.\n\nFor whooping cough: Clinical symptoms of whooping cough are mainly spasmodic cough, during which nasal discharge and tears flow, the whole face turns red, resembling cough due to liver fire attacking the lung. Prunella vulgaris clears liver heat, drains liver fire, calms liver qi, and relieves qi stagnation, preventing the lung metal from being attacked. The method uses 15 g Prunella vulgaris, 10 g Morus alba root bark, 9 g Scutellaria baicalensis, 9 g Lycium chinense root bark, 10 g loquat leaf, 9 g stir-fried earthworm, 10 g stiff silkworm, 3 g licorice, decocted in water, one dose daily, to treat pediatric whooping cough with good results. \n\nFor stubborn hemoptysis (coughing blood) due to TB and bronchial dilation: xia ku cao 30 g, bai bu (Stemona root) 20 g, huang qin (Scutellaria baicalensis) 12 g, xing ren (Apricot kernel) 12 g, dai zhe shi (Haematitum) 12 g.\n\nFor chronic headache: \n\nFor acute infectious kerato-conjunctivitis: xia ku cao 15 g, ju hua (Chrysanthemum flower) 15 g, pu gong ying (Dandelion) 30 g. Decoction, use as tea.",
        "Contraindications": "Use with caution in cases of pixu (spleen deficiency).\n\nLong term usage can cause irritation to the stomach and intestines. If long term use is required, add dang shen (Codonopsis root) and bai zhu (Atractylodes macrocephala) to the formula.\n\nDecoction of xia ku cao can raise the values of ALT and AST, indicating potential hepatotoxicity.",
        "Research": "Animal studies showed that xia ku cao can slow down the formation of atherosclerosis in the aorta, lower blood lipids, and had good results in treating cardiovascular diseases.\n\nXia ku cao injection for subcutaneous injection in animals can shrink thymus glands and spleens and enlarge adrenal glands, with marked elevation of plasma corticosteroid levels, indicating an immunosuppressive effect.\n\nDecoction of xia ku cao raised ALT and AST values in laboratory mice, indicating potential liver toxicity.",

Antifungal activity was evaluated for the essential oil and simultaneously for Amphotricin B.
