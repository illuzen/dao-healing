If the dosage is too large, toxic reactions include headache, restless, insomnia, palpitation, tightness in chest area, tears and nose dripping, uncomfortable, fever, sweating nonstop, upper belly discomfort, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, body temperature and blood pressure rising, it can cause heart rate to go up or heart attack or stroke. Large dosage can suppress the heart and causes the heart to slow down. Not to use in patients who are deficient, with instant sweating, cough with asthma due to qixu (qi deficient), pixu (spleen deficient) with edema, or patients  with heart problems, or hypertension or prostatitis,  and patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency should not use ma huang.Traditionally ma huang is not used in diet formulae nor as a recreation drug. Avoid prescribing ma huang if you do not have the experience and diagnostic skill especially in pulse reading. It can be dangerous if used incorrectly.Prolong use for weight loss in the West has caused serious liver problems. The severity of liver injury due to ephedra ranges from mild, asymptomatic elevations in serum enzymes to clinically apparent acute liver injury and to acute liver failure. Chronic use of ephedra has been linked to a chronic hepatitis-like syndrome, but recovery is prompt when ephedra is stopped. There have been no instances of vanishing bile duct syndrome attributed to ephedra. Recurrence of liver injury is typical when ephedra is restarted, and rechallenge should be avoided. There is no apparent cross sensitivity to liver injury between ephedra and other weight loss agents or herbal preparations, but ephedra was previously found in many commercial herbal preparations.[1] Do not use with Furanzolidone, (Furazolidonum，Furoxone). May induce mania if used  with phenelzine.患有葡萄糖-六-磷酸鹽去氫酵素缺乏症(蚕豆症)之病人忌用。麻黃具有興奮大腦皮層 的作用，如用量較大，輕者包括口乾﹐神經質﹐過度興奮而致失眠，焦慮，頭痛，視力模糊以及意識混亂 且易發汗，發汗過多易造成心悸，嚴重時腦出血，癲癇，精神官能症及心律不整﹐ 還可能導致休克。 因此，若體虛之人，表虛自汗，氣虛喘咳， 脾虛水腫者，患心臟病，高血壓，前列腺炎患者不可用。 劑量過大能抑制心臟﹐可導致心跳變慢。葡萄糖-6-磷酸鹽去氫酶缺乏症者不可用麻黄。傳統上，麻黄不作减肥用，亦非作娱樂用。如對中醫的辨証有經驗，精通把脉最好避免用麻黄。不可與呋喃唑酮(痢特靈 ) 同用。如與苯乙肼同用可能導致癫狂。Antidote:If toxicity occurs after taken orally, induce vomiting, and use laxative to decrease the absorption. If there is serious nervous reaction or spasm, chloral hydrate CCl3.CH(OH)2  can be used. Oxygen can also be used.如果內服後有中毒現象，可催吐，並用瀉藥，以減少吸收。如果有嚴重的神經反應或痙攣，可用水合三氯乙醛 CCl3.CH(OH)2 ，氧氣也可使用。[1] http://livertox.nih.gov/Ephedra.htm The Food and Drug Administration of U.S.A. has banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra effective on April 12, 2004.

        "Research": "Ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) was incubated with eight different common antibiotics in a culture medium containing a fixed amount of a standard strain of Staphylococcus aureus. The antibiotic compounds used were: penicillin G, doxycycline, streptomycin, cloxacillin, chloramphenicol, cefradine, ampicillin, and polymyxin B. They were used in varying concentrations, ranging between 0.000005–125.0 micrograms/ml or units, respectively. First, their minimal inhibitory concentrations were established in the absence of EEP. Then, EEP was added in concentrations up to 600 micrograms/ml. EEP showed a marked synergistic effect on the antibacterial activity of streptomycin and cloxacillin, and a moderate synergistic effect on the others—except ampicillin.\n Propolis inhibits the activity of several Streptococcus (鏈球菌) species that cause dental caries. Japanese researchers reported that laboratory rats fed with propolis developed significantly fewer caries compared to those on a regular diet. \n Propolis can help control blood glucose levels and modulate glucose and lipid metabolism, leading to reduced lipid peroxidation and enhanced scavenging of free radicals in rats with diabetes mellitus. Propolis also exhibits inhibitory effects against the hepatitis B virus. In addition, propolis offers specific protection against Streptococcus mutans and several other streptococcal species closely related to the pathogen that causes strep throat. Streptococcus mutans is a key species responsible for dental caries. Flavonoids of propolis lower transaminase, enhancing liver cell regeneration and preventing liver cirrhosis.",

The antibiotic compounds used were: penicillin G, doxycycline, streptomycin, cloxacillin, chloramphenicol, cefradine, ampicillin and polymyxin B. They were used in varying levels, ranging between 0.000005-125.0 micrograms/ml or units, resp. Firstly, their minimal inhibitory concentrations were established in the absence of EEP. Then EEP was added in concentrations up to 600 micrograms/ml. EEP had a marked synergistic effect on the antibacterial activity of streptomycin and cloxacillin, and a moderate synergistic effect on the others, except ampicillin. [2] Propolis inhibits the activity of several streptococcal bacteria species 鏈球菌 that cause dental caries. Japanese researchers reported that propolis fed laboratory rats had far fewer caries than those given a regular diet. [3]Propolis can control blood glucose and modulate the metabolism of glucose and blood lipid, leading to decreased outputs of lipid peroxidation and scavenge the free radicals in rats with diabetes mellitus.[5]Propolis also inhibits hepatitis B virus.Propolis protects specifically against Streptococcus mutans and several other strep species that are closely related to the germ that causes strep throat. Streptococcus mutans are species that cause dental caries.Chemical ingredients:化 學 成 份:flavonoids黃酮類化合物caffeic acid phenethyl ester [4]咖啡酸苯乙酯 [4]waxes 7.5% ~ 35%蠟 7.5% ~ 35%10% volatile oils揮發油 10%5% pollen花粉 5% 3 ~ 10% fatty acids脂肪酸 3 ~ 10%4  ~19% other compounds其他化合物 4 ~19 %aromatic acids芳香酸 類  terpenoids松烯類aldehydes醛類alcohols乙 醇aliphatic acids脂族酸esters脂族酸酯amino acids氨基酸steroids固醇類sugars糖類Magnesium, Zinc, Iron, Calcium and Copper鎂﹐ 鋅﹐ 鐵﹐ 鈣﹐銅。Vitamin B1, B2, B6, C, E維生素 B1, B2, B6, C, E Zhong Hua Ben Cao (Chinese Materia Medica), vol 9, mentioned about propolis:1. anti-microbes that cause diseases: effective against bacteria, fungi, viruses that cause tuberculosis, inflammation of the stomach, edema of the legs, skin problems.2. sedative and anesthesia effect, and other neurological effects: it is effective in treating insomnia, for pain relieving and various neurological problems.3. promotes healing effect of tissue: shortens the healing time  by 1/3 ~2/3 of ulcerated wounds, especially in wounds of diabetics; ulcers of the mouth, ulcers of the stomach, ulcers of the duodenum, bed sores, burns.4. effects on heart and brain circulation: enhances the contraction of cardiac muscles, dilates blood vessels, lowers the triglycerides in the blood. The effects are obvious in prevention and treatment of hypertension, heart disease, and arteriosclerosis5. protecting liver effect: lowers ALT, protects liver cells, effective on treatment of hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis C.6. anti-tumor effect: propolis contains PRCA factors; so it is effective in treatment and assisting treatment of various tumors.7. anti free radicals effect: it is a very strong anti free radicals substance. It is a top choice of anti free radicals material for some serious sickness.8. so far no side effects have been noted.Flavonoids of propolis and other substances can lower transaminase and can promote regeneration and prevent cirrhosis. Such patients should not take alcoholic propolis products, but should take higher levels of non-alcoholic propolis soft capsules or concentrated fluid.《中 華本草》第九卷關於蜂膠的說明如下。  第一，有抗病原微生物的作用：因此對由細菌、病毒、真菌所引起的各種感染類疾病，如：結核、胃炎、腳氣、皮膚病等炎症都有效。  第二，它有鎮靜、麻醉及其他神經系統作用：這三種功能使它具備了治療失眠、止痛及各種神經系統的疾病的功效。  第三，促進組織修復：可以促進潰瘍癒合，縮短1/3一2/3病程，特別對糖尿病傷口不愈、口腔潰瘍、胃潰瘍、十二指腸潰瘍、褥瘡、燒傷效果迅速而神奇。  第四，它對心腦血管系統有作用：能增強心肌收縮力、擴張血管、降低血中甘油三醋的含量等作用，對於預防和治療高血壓、心臟病、動脈粥樣硬化的作用非常明顯。  第五，它有保肝作用：可以降低丙穀轉氨誨、解肝毒、保護肝細胞，因此對乙型肝炎、肝硬化、丙型肝炎有極好的治療作用。  第六，它有抗腫瘤作用：對各種腫瘤可以起到良好的治療和輔助治療作用。  第七，它有清除自由基及其他作用：自由基是健康的大敵，有80多種重症疾病都與它有關。蜂膠是一種很強的自由基清除劑，是一些重症患者的首選抗氧化劑。  第八，蜂膠無副作用：正是這一作用，使蜂膠具備了長期服用的優先條件。  綜上所述，正是蜂膠這種綜合的作用為它奠定了廣泛的治療基礎。再:蜂膠能控制血糖和調節血糖和血脂的代謝，導致輸出減少脂質過氧化 和清除自由基的糖尿病大鼠。 [1]蜂膠中的黃酮類等物質有降低轉氨酶作用，促進肝細胞再生、防止肝 硬變。此類肝病患者，不適合服用含酒精的蜂膠製品，而應服用不含 酒精的含量較高的蜂膠軟膠囊或濃縮液。[1] Qiao Z, China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica, Aug. 1991;16:481-2[2] Krol W, Scheller S, Shani J, Pietsz G, Czuba Z.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Silesian School of Medicine, Zabrze-Rokitnica, Poland. , Arzneimittel-Forschung, May 1993;43:607-9[3] Ikeno K, Caries research, 1991;25:347-51[4]  Cancer Lett. 2002 Jan 10;175(1):53-61.[5] Pharmacol Res. 2005 Feb;51(2):147-52.Search this siteProblems with website?
