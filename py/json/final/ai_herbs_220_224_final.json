Large doses have shown to be toxic for the heart of frogs.\nSheng di huang: contraindicated in cases of pixu with dampness, in cases of yangxu, and in pregnant women with blood deficiency of pixu or weixu (stomach deficiency).\nShu di huang: less toxic with milder side effects, but generally avoided when spleen and stomach are deficient, with copious phlegm, and when dampness accumulates in the middle jiao.\nPossible side effects: diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, weakness, and palpitations.",
    "Research": "Treatment with hot water extracted Lycium barbarum and Rehmannia glutinosa (0.05% and 0.15% for each) for eight weeks protects against necrotic damage, indicated by decreases in plasma ALT and AST activities, and suppresses liver fibrosis by down-regulation of liver inflammation in rats with CCl(4)-induced liver injury. [1]\nTreatment of hepatitis: there are clinical reports that di huang and gan cao combined either in intramuscular or oral application have shown that it promotes the recovery of liver function, especially the decrease of ALT was obvious, and there were no local or systemic bad effects.\nHot water-extracted crude gou qi zi (2–5 g/L) and di huang (5–10 g/L) inhibit proliferation and stimulate p53-mediated apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. [2]",
    "Notes": "When di huang has been just prepared by drying, it is called sheng di huang. Sheng means raw.\nWhen di huang has been prepared by steaming together with other herbs, it is called shu di huang. Shu means cooked.\nP53 is a protein that is the product of a tumor suppressor gene, regulates cell growth and proliferation, and prevents unrestrained cell division after chromosomal damage (as from ultraviolet or ionizing radiation). The absence of p53 as a result of a gene mutation increases the risk of developing various cancers. (The American Heritage Medical Dictionary)",

    "Dosage": "To take orally in powder form: 0.7–2 g. Chinese measure given: 內服：研末，2～5分.",
    "Samples of Formulae": "Name of formula: Diang Kuang Ma Bao San (癲狂馬寶散).\nApplication: For treatment of madness, manic anxiety, delirium, and mania caused by hot phlegm (symptoms include high fever, delirium, even epilepsy and resulting in mania), spitting saliva, talking without making sense, fright and insomnia, crying and laughing, and schizophrenia.\nComposition (weights in grams): Ma Bao (horse bezoar) 30 g, Hu Po (amber) 3 g, Long Xian Xiang (ambergris) 1 g, Zhen Zhu (pearl; bake with tofu) 0.3 g, Niu Huang (bovine bezoar) 1.5 g.\nPreparation: Grind all into fine powder.

Indications—mental confusion, manic restlessness; phlegm-heat obscuring the Heart orifices with high fever, coma, delirium, possibly convulsions; foaming at the mouth, unclear consciousness, incoherent speech, violent agitation, vexation and restlessness, startled insomnia, crying and laughing without constancy, and schizophrenia. Classical weights given: 馬寶 2兩, 琥珀 1錢, 龍涎香 1錢, 珍珠（豆腐炙）1分, 牛黃5分. Preparation: ground to fine powder, bottled 3分 per bottle. Dosage: mild cases 1/2 bottle (一分半), severe cases 1 bottle (3分).",
    "Contraindications": "Not to use in cases of cold stomach or in damp phlegm.\nWarning about authenticity: There are fake ma bao in the market; some are made of cement and some are gastric calculi from other animals used as substitutes. Genuine ma bao mainly contains ammonium magnesium phosphate, whereas fake ma bao mainly contains calcium carbonate.",
    "Research": "Analysis and identification of calculus Equi components: Components of genuine Calculus Equi and false ma bao were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The main components of genuine ma bao are NH4MgPO4·6H2O (struvite), NH4MgPO4·H2O (dittmarite), and MgHPO4·3H2O, whereas the main components of false ma bao are CaCO3 (present as calcite—hexagonal crystal system—and aragonite—orthorhombic crystal system). PMID: 9642387.\nStudy details (Chinese text): Eight genuine ma bao samples and one fake were analyzed. Instrument: Rigaku D/MAX-RA X-ray diffractometer (Cu target, wavelength λ = 0.1541 nm). Sample-type findings: ‘Oil ma bao’ and ‘brown ball ma bao’ consist of NH4MgPO4·6H2O, NH4MgPO4·H2O, and MgHPO4·3H2O. ‘Grass-striated ma bao’ mainly contains MgHPO4·3H2O with relatively less NH4MgPO4·6H2O. ‘Oval ma bao’ and ‘light-yellow ma bao’ mainly contain NH4MgPO4·6H2O with less MgHPO4·3H2O; ‘gray ma bao’ is similar. ‘Brown-round ma bao’ and ‘red-flake ma bao’ contain NH4MgPO4·6H2O and MgHPO4·3H2O, with overall lower peak intensities, indicating relatively lower contents of these components than in the oval and light-yellow types. The fake sample’s main components were two CaCO3 phases: calcite and aragonite. The authors note that previous literature claiming the main components are magnesium phosphate, calcium carbonate, and magnesium carbonate requires reconsideration based on these findings.\nTraditional identification method noted: Place a small amount of powder on tinfoil and heat from below; if the powder quickly agglomerates and emits a horse-urine odor, it is genuine ma bao; if not, it is fake.",
    "Notes": "Pattern explanation—Yinxu with hot phlegm syndrome: cough with sticky white or yellow phlegm (possibly with blood), achy and tight sensation in the chest and flanks, sometimes low-grade fever, poor sleep at night, red tongue with thin yellow coat, slippery and thin rapid pulse.\nPattern explanation—Damp phlegm syndrome: cough with abundant phlegm, chest fullness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, palpitation.\nPattern explanation—Cold stomach syndrome: stomach ache due to weather turning cold, bodily chill, or eating cold food; feeling cold in the stomach with pain that is alleviated by warmth.",

    "Research": "According to pharmacological research, sugarcane (gan zhe) possesses the functions of clearing heat and moistening dryness, stopping cough, clearing phlegm, and descending qi. It can be used for febrile disease injuring fluids, vexation with thirst, retching and vomiting, lung dryness cough, and dry stool constipation, and it can relieve alcohol toxin (hangover).",
    "Notes": "Nutritional profile and preservation: Gan zhe shao (tip of sugar cane) contains 12–13% crude protein, 16 kinds of amino acids, and many types of sugar. Under winter storage conditions, anaerobic fermentation by lactic acid bacteria gradually converts sugars into lactic acid; when lactic acid reaches a certain concentration, it inhibits destruction of nutrients by other microorganisms, preserving green color, juice, and nutritional value. Winter storage of the tips addresses feed scarcity for farm animals in winter and early spring.\n\nFresh tips contain abundant chlorophyll, amino acids, crude protein, and sugars. When they become withered, these nutrients are destroyed; therefore, they should be stored for winter while still green, before freezing.\n\nWinter storage methods for animal feed: 1) Dig a pit: choose elevated terrain with low groundwater and good sun exposure; dig a rectangular pit 100–150 cm deep and 60–80 cm wide; length is not limited. 2) Build a storage pool using concrete and red bricks. 3) Cover the floor and walls of an abandoned house with plastic film for storage. After chopping the tips, compact them as tightly as possible, cover with agricultural film, and seal with river sand or mud. Do not open before use to maintain an anaerobic environment. After 50–60 days, open for use; open only one spot and remove material in sections and layers. If mold is found, discard the moldy portion; if the tips are yellow‑green, soft, juicy, and have a wine aroma, they are top grade and can be fed directly to cattle, sheep, rabbits, and geese, or mixed with concentrate feed.\n\nProperty: sweet and cool/cold.",

Under storage condition in winter temperature, due to anaerobic fermentation of lactic acid bacteria, the sugar content gradually turns into lactic acid. When the lactic acid arrives at a certain level, it will inhibit the destruction of the nutrients by other micro organism. Thus the tips of the sugar canes can preserve the green color, the juice and the nutrition value. So, winter storage of the tips of sugar cane is a good method to solve the feed of farm animals for winter and early spring when the feeds are scarce. The fresh tips of sugar cane contain rich nutrition, large amount of chlorophyll, amino acid, crude protein and sugar. When they are wilted, the nutrients can be destroyed. So, it is a good practice to store them for winter when they are still green. Medical Application: for treating irritability, thirst, nausea, vomiting, dry cough, hard stool, hangover from drinking alcohol. Property: cool, sweet. Chemical ingredients of the  juice of the tips of sugar cane:aspartic acid：37mg/100mlglutamic acid： 10mg/100mlserine： 12mg/100mlglycine： 5mg/100mlhistidine：22.6mg/100mlarginineprolinevalinemethionine.  Sponsors' Ads by Google 以下為谷歌所提供贊助者之廣告 甘蔗梢是寶，冬貯養畜好 發布時間：2006-2-14 來源：中國農民網 　甘蔗梢粗蛋白質含量高達12%～13%，含有16種氨基酸和多種糖。在冬貯狀態下，通過乳菌等厭氧發酵，甘蔗梢中的糖分會逐步轉化為乳酸，當乳酸達到一 定濃度時，就會抑制甘蔗梢中的營養成分被其他微生物破壞，從而使甘蔗梢長期保持青綠、多汁，營養價值不會發生太大的變化。因此，冬貯甘蔗梢是解決冬季和初 春家畜缺乏青飼料的好辦法。鮮嫩的甘蔗梢營養豐富，含大量葉綠素、氨基酸、粗蛋白質和糖分。甘蔗梢干枯後，這些營養成分都會遭到破壞，甚至轉化為有毒物質 ，產生大量有害細菌、病毒和寄生虫。因此，應在冰凍前、甘蔗梢尚為青綠色時冬貯。  　　冬貯通常採用三種方法：  　　一是挖窖。要選擇地勢高、地下水位低、向陽的地方挖窖。要挖成長方形，深100～150厘米、寬60～80厘米，長度不限。  　　二是用混凝土和紅磚建池。  　　三是將廢棄的房屋、地面和牆壁用薄膜覆蓋起來進行冬貯。把甘蔗梢切碎後放入貯藏池，千方百計壓緊，越緊越好。最後用農膜覆蓋，用河沙或泥土密封。在取 用前切忌開封，以免破壞厭氧環境。冬貯50～60天後便可開封取用。取用時，隻能打開一處，分段分層取用。啟封後，如發現霉變，則應把霉變部分除去；如果 發現甘蔗梢顏色黃綠、柔軟多汁、有酒香味，則為上等品，可直接飼喂牛、羊、兔、鵝等草食畜禽，也可以添加一些精飼料混合飼喂。 性味：甘甜， 寒。 天然甘蔗梢汁中含有：天門冬氨酸：37mg/100ml ，穀 氨酸： 10mg/100ml，絲氨酸： 12mg/100ml ，甘氨酸： 5mg/100ml，組按酸： 22.6mg/100ml，精氨酸，脯氨酸 ，纈氨酸，蛋氨酸。  經藥理研究，甘蔗具有清熱潤燥、止咳、清 痰、下氣等功用，可用於熱病傷津、心煩口渴、反胃嘔吐，肺燥咳嗽、大便燥結等症，還可解酒毒。 A manuscript... writing, translating and proofreading  in progressClick here for inquiry Copyright Notice 按此看關於版權問題List of Health ProblemsChinese Herb DictionaryToxicity of Some Herbs Side Effect of Some Herbs Herbs that can be toxic to kidneysTraditional Chinese MedicineTCM DiagnosisSamples of FormulaeAcupuncturecopy right 版權所有Qigong (chi kung)Prescribed Drug DictionaryEmail our web master for  your suggestion (not for inquiry)Biochemistry DictionaryGeneral Online LibraryQigong classesFake Email WarningResearch LibrarianSearchQigong classesHomeWeather ReportDisclaimerSearch this site         \n Last  \nLast update: July 24, 2012; 3:00 p.m. LAH",
