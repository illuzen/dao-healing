Moisten a glass rod with iodine test solution, coat with a small amount of royal jelly across a white porcelain plate, then scratch with the glass rod; the scratch marks should not be obviously blue, green or red-brown (checking starch). (4) Take a little royal jelly in a test tube, dilute with a small amount of distilled water, stir, add a few drops of Fehling's reagent solution, slightly boil in water bath for 1–2 minutes, remove and examine; it should not show red or reddish brown (checking honey).\n\nNote: Fehling's solution is an aqueous solution of copper sulfate, sodium hydroxide, and potassium sodium tartrate used to test for the presence of sugars and aldehydes in a substance, such as urine.\n\nBiotin (生物素) is one of the B vitamins, also called vitamin H, vitamin B7, and coenzyme R (輔酶R).",

(2) A halogen moisture analyzer can be used to quickly determine that water content. It should  not contain more than 70% of water. (3) with a lit match close to the royal jelly, there should be no brown particles melting rapidly (for checking wax). Moisten a glass rod  with iodine test solution. Coat with a small amount of royal jelly across the white porcelain plate then scratch with the glass rod. The scratch marks should not be obviously blue, green or red-brown (for checking starch) (4) Take a little test tube using a small amount of royal jelly diluted with distilled water, stir, add few drops of Fehling's reagent test solution, slightly boil in water bath for 1-2 minutes, remove and examine. It should not show red or reddish brown (for checking honey). 理化鑒別:（1）Ph應為3.5-4.8。 （2）用快速鹵素水分測定法測定，含水量不得大於70%。 （3）用點燃的火柴接近蜂乳，應無黃褐色顆粒迅速速熔化（檢查蠟片）。 用蘸有碘試液的玻棒，劃過涂有少量蜂乳的白瓷板上，劃痕處不得顯藍色、綠色或紅褐色（檢查澱粉類。 （4）取蜂乳少許置試管中用少量蒸餾水稀釋攪勻，加斐林試液數滴，水浴上微沸1-2min，取出觀察，不得變紅或紅棕色（檢查蜂蜜）。Modern Research:現代研究﹕ Toxicity & Cautions:毒素與禁忌﹕not to use in cases of diarrhea due to infection.
