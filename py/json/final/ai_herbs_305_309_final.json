Indications: gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown pathogens, bleeding ulcer, and pulmonary hemoptysis.\n\nFor treatment of vaginal bleeding: zhu ma gen (苧麻根, ramie root) 150 g, ai gen (艾根, mugwort root) 100 g, pig kidneys 1 pair (chopped), sweet rice wine 50 c.c., small amount of salt.

Reported outcomes: bleeding periods were shortened and the amount of bleeding decreased. [1]\n\nTreatment of vaginal bleeding: zhu ma gen 150 g, ai gen 100 g, pig kidneys 1 pair (chopped), sweet rice wine 50 c.c., small amount of salt; decoction taken orally once daily. Total 83 cases: 64 cases due to insertion of birth control rings, 62 effective; 19 cases due to abortions, all effective. Total effectiveness 97.6%. [2]",
    "Notes": "Actions and indications citing Zhong Hua Ben Cao (《中華本草》).\n\nPresent-day application: Today, it is mainly substituted with stems. The stems can be repeatedly harvested up to 15 times a year. Using the stems to substitute the roots can greatly lower the cost for herb farmers.\n\nClassic treatises:\n1) Ben Cao Jing Shu (《本草經疏》): Zhu gen is used in childhood chidan because its cold nature can cool the blood; soaking ramie juice to treat thirst is due to its heat-removing function. Ri Hua Zi uses it to treat heat in the Heart and diaphragm, leakage of fetus with bleeding, vexation before and after childbirth, epidemic febrile diseases with heat, great thirst with mania, and for arrow poison, snake and insect bites, all due to its cold nature that can resolve heat and cool the blood.\n2) Ben Cao Shu (《本草述》): Zhu gen, according to Danxi, greatly tonifies Yin and simultaneously moves congealed blood; sweet-cold medicinals can drain fire. This substance stops bleeding strangury, treats erysipelas; it may enter the blood aspect and drain heat. It is especially effective for calming the fetus and treating leakage of blood, thus its functions of supplementing Yin and activating blood are evident, not merely draining heat.\n3) Ben Cao Zheng Yi (《本草正義》): Bai zhu (white ramie) is cold; ancient formulas often state it treats urinary obstruction, five types of strangury with heat binding, thus it has the power to drain heat and free strangury, hence Ri Hua Ben Cao calls it sweet, cold, and slippery. Modern practitioners tend to use it to calm the fetus, but being both cold and slippery it is not suitable for fetal movement; the root directs downward and is contraindicated in pregnancy. Surveying medical texts, only Mei Shi Ji Yan Fang uses it for fetal movement with sudden discharge of yellow fluid; otherwise rarely seen. Danxi also says it moves congealed blood, which conflicts with fetal movement, so it should not be used as a routine fetus-calming drug.",

If you need them in a hurry contact our Research Librarian. 【名家論述】①《 本草經疏 》：苧根，《別錄》在小兒赤丹，為其寒能涼血也。 漬苧汁療渴者，除熱之功也。 《日華子》用以治心膈熱，漏胎下血，胎前產後心煩，天行熱疾，大渴發狂，及罯毒箭，蛇虫咬，皆以其 性寒能解熱涼血故也。  ②《本草述》：苧根，丹溪謂其大補陰而即行滯血，足以補為行也。 夫甘寒之藥能瀉火，此味止血淋，治丹毒，或入血分而瀉熱乎?但就其安胎治漏血尤效，則補陰活血之功，又豈徒以瀉熱與他味問論乎。其和血便在補陰，而能行能止之故可以思矣。  ③《本草正義》：白苧性寒，古方多言其主治小便不通，五淋熱結等証，則有泄熱通利之力，是以《 日華本草 》謂其甘寒而滑。乃近人偏以為安胎之用，實則既寒且滑，必非胎動者所宜；且根主下行，尤為妊娠禁品。考古今醫藥諸書，惟 《梅師集驗方》用以治胎動忽下黃汁，此外殊不多見，丹溪且言其行滯血，則更與胎動大相刺謬，又何可為安胎套藥耶。  Search this siteProblems with website?
