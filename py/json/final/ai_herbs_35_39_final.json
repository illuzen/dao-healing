The formula consists of Dang Gui (Angelica sinensis), Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), Tao Ren (peach kernel), He Jiang (dark baked ginger), and Zhi Gan Cao (honey-fried licorice root). This classical prescription promotes blood circulation, dispels blood stasis, warms the meridians, and alleviates pain, making it especially effective in addressing abdominal discomfort and stagnation following childbirth.",
        "Contraindications": "Not advised in cases of dampness with fullness, flatulence or chronic diarrhea. Not recommended for prolonged use or large dosages by some women after menopause or some men. Overcooking decreases effectiveness due to loss of volatile oils.",
        "Research": "Anti-cancer research showed five polysaccharides of ming xian dang gui inhibited EC, Hep, S180, Lewis B16 implanted tumors in rats by up to 39%. Few side effects noted, suitable for long term use. Australian research noted frequent ingestion of ginseng and dang gui accelerates multiplication of breast cancer cells. Dang gui alone showed no estrogen-like response on endometrial thickness or vaginal maturation, not better than placebo in relieving menopausal symptoms. Huang qi (Astragalus) and dang gui extract at a 3:1 ratio showed breast cancer cell suppression.",
        "Notes": "Sudden deafness, bronchial asthma, stomach and duodenal ulcers, limb paralysis in toddlers, and numerous other ailments have been listed as treatable by dang gui. Some methods of treatments remain undocumented in the original text (marked as Methods to be loaded). Detailed clinical study results showed efficacy in conditions such as stroke, headaches, psoriasis and asthma using intravenous and shu xue injection methods. Dang gui jin you wan (preparation using essential oil component ligustilide) reported effective against asthma with minimal side effects. \n DBH (Dopamine β-Hydroxylase): Dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) is an enzyme involved in the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. Elevated serum levels of DBH have been reported in migraine patients during acute attacks. Moreover, significantly increased DBH activity has also been observed during headache-free intervals, which may predispose individuals to the onset of migraine episodes. \n Shu Xue (腧穴): In traditional Chinese medicine, xue refers to “cave,” “depression,” or “point.” All acupuncture points along the body’s meridians (channels) are known as xue. Among these, the points that reflect the function of internal organs are specifically called shu points, or shu xue. These are primarily located along the bladder meridian and are key locations for diagnosis and treatment in acupuncture and moxibustion.",
