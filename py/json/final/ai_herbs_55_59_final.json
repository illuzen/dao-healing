According to Ouyang Wen Zhong, he once suffered from acute diarrhea that could not be cured by official physicians. His wife mentioned a remedy from the market costing only three wen per dose, but he initially refused. She secretly gave him the medicine, and he recovered after a single dose. Upon inquiry, it turned out to be che qian zi (Plantago seed) ground into powder, 2 qian taken with rice water. It was said that this herb promotes urination without disturbing vital qi, thus helping to separate the turbid and clear fluids and restoring proper digestive function. It can also clear liver heat to treat red eyes and visual obstructions.
