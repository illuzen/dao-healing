        "Notes": "Da zao are black in color and hong zao are smaller and red in color. Both are from the same kind of fruit.

The editor has not found any classical Chinese medical literature mentioning that the pits are hot in characteristic.\n\n註：紅棗為新鲜棗果直接晒乾而成的。大棗（黑棗）為紅棗在棉子油，松煙水中煮熟，再用煙火熏烤成的。棗核含類黄酮對DPPH自由基有很强的清除活性[1]。民間認為棗核性熱。常將棗核除去。編者沒看到有中醫古典書籍提到棗核性熱。",

The total serum protein obviously was higher than those of control group, after feed the decoction of da zao continuously for one week.Anti-cancer, anti-mutation: it inhibits the multiplying of cancer cells of mice.Increases the muscle strength: after continuously feeding the decoction for 3 weeks, the body weight of mice, compared to control group, increased and the swimming time increased.Da zao can increase the amount of monocytes in the body: can improve the function of mononuclear phagocyte system, protect the liver, improve the strength of the body.Da zao can increase the oxygen content of the body, nourish the cells. It is a mild tonic.(1).中 樞神經鎮靜作用：其中有效成份與酸棗仁相同，有鎮靜，催眠和降壓的作用。  (2).肝臟的保護作用：四氯化碳損傷肝臟之家兔，喂食大棗煎 劑連續一周，血清總白蛋白與白蛋白較對照組明顯增加。  (3).抗癌抗突變作用：對小鼠有抑制癌細胞的增殖作用。  (4).增強肌力作用：連續喂食大棗煎劑三周，小鼠體重較對照組增加，而且游泳時 間增長。  (5) 大棗能提高體內單核白血細胞：吞噬細胞系統的噬功能，有保護肝臟，增強體力的作用。  (6) 大棗能使血中含氧量增強，滋養全身細胞，是一種藥效緩和的強壯劑。 據中藥免疫 學中說： (1).對cAMP的影響：大棗 中含豐富的cAMP樣物質，人口服後末稍血漿及白血 球細胞內的cAMP含量均明顯上升，cAMP/ cGMP比值上升，這是 大棗抗過敏的藥理機制。服用大棗之方劑，如葛根 湯, ，麥門冬湯，小柴胡湯後末梢白血球細胞內的cAMP含量較對照組高出10~15倍 ，如 此等方劑除去大棗後則無此作用。哮喘病人白血球細胞中cAMP/ cGMP比值低於正常，服小青龍湯加大棗後比值上升，引起支氣管 擴張而起平喘作 用。鑒於cAMP有 廣泛生理效應，對免疫功能亦有 重要影響，故大棗很值得研究。  (2)對抗體產生影響：以大鼠的嗜同種抗體作指標，大棗的酒精萃取物能抑制抗體 產生，作用強度為100毫克相當於硫唑嘌呤（Imuran）5~10毫 克的劑量。  (3).護肝及增強體力等作用：小白鼠灌服大棗湯後三周，體重增加，體力增強（ 游泳時間延長）。對四氯化碳損傷了肝臟的家兔，能使其血清 總蛋白及 白蛋白量較對照組明顯增加，故有促進生長，增強體力及 護肝作用。以上中文部 分來 源：http://www.dharma.com.tw/x2gb/d32health/H417WellSupply10.htmSamples of formulae:處方舉例：gan mai da zao tang 甘麥大棗湯,gui pi tang  歸脾湯,ge gen tang 葛根湯,gui zhi tang 桂枝湯xing su san 杏蘇散Chemical ingredients:化學成份﹕(1) Organic acid: betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, catechin, oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic  acid, stearic acid, myristic acid.(2) 3-O-trans-p-counmaroyl maslinic acid, 3-O-cis-pcoumaroyl  maslinic acid, alphitolic acid, 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl alphitolic acid, 2-O-trans-p-coumarolyl alphitolic acid, 3-O-cis-p-coumaroylalphitolic acid, zizyphus saponin I, II, II and jujuboside B.

        "Notes": "ma chi xian has two varieties: red stem and green stem. The green stem ma chi xian is more effective for medical purposes.\n\nThis plant is both herb and vegetable, non-toxic and has anti-cancer properties. In folk practice, it is used for upset stomach, diarrhea and other digestive issues, with effects as good as western medicine. If western medicine is not available, this can be used in emergency. In wilderness survival, it is important to know and use it.",
