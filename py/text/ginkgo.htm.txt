Effect on Respiratory System2. Effect on Smooth Muscles3. Effect on Circulatory System4. Effect on Brain Circulation5. Effect on Free Radicals6. Effect of Anti Bacteria7. Other Effects8. Toxicity Side EffectRaw ginkgo nuts are toxic. Over consuming can cause vomiting, pain in the abdomen, diarrhea, muscle spasm, anxiety and difficulty in breathy. [31] Some classical medical literature reported that over consuming had caused death in a group of refugees. The outer skin of the fruit contains ginkgo toxin. Ginkgo phenols and ginkgo toxin possess effect of hemolysis. Ginkgo toxin possesses  an anesthetic  effect on the central nervous system of frogs. A venous injection of 0.2g/kg on rabbits caused temporary raising of blood pressure then  with subsequent dropping of blood  pressure, breathing difficulty, panic and death.  Using the neutral portion of the gingko seed for skin injection of 6mg/kg has also caused death in mice.[3]  Using a large dosage of ginkgo leaf extract for venous injection continually for one week on dogs caused salivating, vomiting, diarrhea, and lack of appetite. In lab examination of tissues, it shows the increase of mucus secretion of the lower abdomen. Local injection causes local blood vessels to harden. It shows that in dogs and rabbits under anesthesia, the movement of intestines increases. A normal amount of flavonol does not affect the blood clotting time. A large dosage can interfere with the blood clotting time. Venous injections of 242mg/kg (in 95% of the cases, 229.6~256.2/kg could be  the fatal limits), of  di-flavonol were applied to mice  and caused acute toxicity symptoms of rapid breathing, sprawling still, and eventually all  died of breathing paralysis.[31]1。對呼吸系統作用 2。對平滑肌作用 3。對循環系統作用 4。對腦循環作用 5。對自由基作用 6。抗細菌的影響 7。其他影響 8。毒副作用生白果是有毒的。過度服用會引起嘔吐，腹部疼痛，腹瀉，肌肉痙攣，焦慮和呼吸困難。 [31 ] 一些古典醫學文獻報導，一批逃難的難民在白果樹林拾取白果煮熟當飯吃造成的集體死亡。水果的外皮含有銀杏毒素。銀杏酚和銀杏毒素具有溶血作用。銀杏毒素具有青蛙的中樞神經系統的麻醉作用。靜脈注射量0.2g/kg對家兔引起血壓的暫時提高再與血壓隨後下降，呼吸困難，恐慌和死亡。用銀杏種子的中性部分皮下注射6mg/kg也致使小鼠死亡。 [3]對狗使用的銀杏葉提取物靜脈注射大劑量連續一個星期會導致垂涎，嘔吐，腹瀉，食慾不振。在實驗室作組織檢查，它顯示了小腹的黏液分泌增加。局部注射引起局部血管硬化。這表明，在麻醉狀態下狗和兔子，腸增加運動。正常量的黃酮醇，不影響血液凝固的時間。大劑量可對血液凝血時間干擾。 242mg/kg二黃酮醇的（在95 ％的情況下， 229.6 〜 256.2/kg可能是致命的限制） ，靜脈注射被應用於小鼠，導致呼吸急促的急性毒性症狀，仍然蔓延，最終全部死亡的呼吸麻痺。 [ 31]  Present Day Applications:    1. Labyrinthine syndrome2. Pimples3. Urolithiasis (formation of calculi in the urinary tract.)Formulae: root of gingko biloba 120 g, rock cane sugar 120 g. Boil with water. Taken orally. 4~5 doses a week. If there is infection of urinary track, use Ba Zheng San with bai hua she she cao. Drink plenty of liquid and excercise (editor note: preferably qigong dong gong). Out of fifty patients, thirty two were healed. Ten patients were improved. Eight patients did not improve.  Average treatment time was 133 days. [3]See usages of leave extract.Sample of Formulae:Ding Chuan Tang for asthma, formulae for yeast infection,定喘湯 治哮喘。帶 下方。Warning:Bai guo nuts are very toxic for children. When using bai guo for asthma therapy, the effective dosage is very close to toxic quantity. Cooking can only destroy the cyanide by hydrolysis but cannot destroy the toxicity caused by ginkgo phenols and ginkgo toxin.A normal amount of flavonol does not affect the blood clotting time. A large dosage can interfere with the blood clotting time. Venous injections of 242mg/kg (in 95% of the cases, 229.6~256.2/kg could be  the fatal limits), of  di-flavonol were applied to mice  and caused acute toxicity symptoms of rapid breathing, sprawling still, and eventually all  died of breathing paralysis.[31] [n] for bibliography see  Research Librarian.  Ginkgo trees do not tolerate high heat or extreme cold. Although the trees are found in more than twenty provinces in China but in many locations they do not bear fruits or bear scanty amount of fruits. In Guilin of Guangxi province in southern part of China, where the altitude is between 280 meters to 600 meters, where the four seasons are distinct, and with abundance of rain water and fertile soil, the ginkgo trees grow well. It is one of the main ginkgo production areas.Search this siteProblems with website? Please Click here for comment.
