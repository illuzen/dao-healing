[0]Ginseng treatment reduces bacterial load and lung pathology in chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia in rats:Toxicity and Side Effects:毒性與 副作 用﹕Toxicity and Side Effects:1. Emotion : causing headaches, insomnia, anxiety.(2, 3, 4)2. Circulatory system: pale face, purple lips, spastic limbs, elevated blood pressure, rapid respiration, even exhaustion and death. (2, 3, 4)3. May cause edema4. Other side effects: hiccups, itchy skin. (2) Generally, the natural saponins are highly toxic. The toxicity of saponin of ginseng is relatively mild. Oral dosage of 100 ml of 3% ginseng tincture may cause anxiety and over-stimulation. Oral dosage of 200 ml may cause allergic reactions of rash, itchiness, dizziness, headache, rising of body temperature and bleeding. There is a report of death after orally taking 500ml. (1) Eleutherosides of ginseng are related to digitalis glycosides, such as digoxin, and may have an additive effect with digoxin. The concurrent  use  of digitalis glycosides and ren shen (ginseng) may increase serum levels of digoxin and possible digitalis glycoside toxicity.A fake substitute is Hua-shan shen (華山參). The shape and color of Hua-shan shen is very similar to ren shen. Although it is also an medicinal herb that is being used for calming and as a cough suppression, cold type of diarrhea, but its dosage is very small: 0.3 g to 0.9 g being used in decoction. Dosages of Hua-shan shen (華山參) over 1 gram can be toxic. Clinical symptoms include: dry mouth, dry tongue, difficulty in swallowing, excitement, hallucination, flushing but without sweat, dilation of pupils, vomiting, dizziness, manic and delirium. The late stage symptoms include slowing down in breathing, rising body temperature but with cold extremities, spasm, coma and even death.May not be suitable during pregnancies.Stalks of ginseng plants contain large amount of calcium oxalate. Calcium oxalate can combine with hydrochloride acid of the stomach and form oxalic acid which is toxic and can promote nausea and vomiting. So, the stalk cannot substitute ginseng in application.Notice:注意：Do not use microwave oven to heat ginseng.不可用微 波爐處理人參。Adulteration:Adulteration:Since ginseng is expensive and difficult to produce, adulteration or substitution with cheaper products is very common in packaged ginseng products. Some manufactured "ginseng" products contain Mandragora officinarum (mandrake, a poisonous narcotic) with hyoscine bromide, rauwolfia alkaloids  with the hypertensive drug reserpine,   cola with caffeine,   phenylbutazone (a carcinogen), and aminopyrine.An independent test commissioned by the health food trade journal �Whole Foods�  found that 60 percent of ginseng products are  worthless because they contained too little of the herb to have any biological effect. Twenty-five percent contained no ginseng at all. Price and Quality:Price and QualityWild ginseng roots cost much more than cultivated roots. There is no fixed market price for good quality wild roots. Usually dealers charge what the market will bear. Chinese Manchuria wild ginseng roots fetch the highest prices in the retail market. Wild root found in Jilin province used to fetch the highest price. Now there are products that called "Jilin ren shen" sell for modest prices, less than those of Korean ginseng.  A good wild Jilin ginseng root of  about 50 grams (a little less than two American ounces) can sell for US $15, 000. Usually the age, fragrance and look of the root, the market supplies, urgency of the buyers and the willingness of the sellers determined the price. Top quality American wild ginseng roots can fetch 600 to 1, 200 dollars a pound. Cultivated American roots sell for US $60 to about US $120 a pound. Price fluctuation is determined more by supply. Usually the demand for the cheaper quality roots is more elastic and the demand for the higher quality roots is more inelastic.Wild ginseng roots usually do not have symmetrical shapes and are much denser than cultivated ones. The wild roots are not even and most of the time are not straight because they have to struggle through the uneven soil in the wild. Cultivated roots are more symmetrical and straighter and much softer than the wild roots. The ring marks are not as dense as those of the wild roots and the roots are less fragrant.  Wild roots have more small, thin, hair-like whiskers growing out from the main roots for seeking water and nutrients in the wild.  The cultivated roots have very little of those because  they are watered and fertilized by farmers. The author was told by a friend who worked for an herb importing company that some crooks in Hong Kong buy American wild ginseng roots and trim off the "whiskers", and then re-attach them to the cultivated Chinese or Korean ginseng roots to make them look wild ginseng before shipping them to Europe and selling them as such. When the unwary buyers cook the roots in water, all the whiskers fall off. (In Cantonese slang, one's phony whiskers falling off means losing one's dignity, because the Chinese revere older people.) Ginseng is also sold in powder form, in capsules, and in extract in the West, to mainly non-Oriental market.. Usually the better quality ginseng roots are sold in root form. It is just like better cuts of beef, tenderloin or filet mignon are not made into hamburger.hong shen  紅參  literally means red ginseng, because of a steaming process used in preparing the raw ginseng. The end product is reddish brown in color.Saponins are any plant glucosides that form soapy lathers when mixed and agitated with water. It is being used in detergents, foaming agents, and emulsifiers. Most saponins are toxic and can cause hemalysis but saponins of ginseng are mild and almost do not have that effect.The chemical structures of saponins of ginseng are completely different from the saponins of other plants. For differentiating the saponins of ginseng from the other saponins, a term 人參皂甙 ginsenoside was created. It was a term combining the word ginseng and glycoside.According to the characteristics and the chemical structures, ginsenosides can be divided into 3 groups:Protopanaxadiol (PD): ginsenoside-Rb1 is one of the important ingredients and it possesses the effect of CNS inhibitionProtopanaxatriol (PT): ginsenoside-Rg1 is one of the important ingredients and it possesses the effect o CNS stimulationOleanolic acid (齊墩果烷酸): saponins of most plants belong to this group.The effects of PD and PT are opposite of each other but do not cancel each other.在植物界一般存在的皂甙大部分属齊墩果烷類。人参皂甙属其它 植物幾乎不存在的大馬樹烷 (dammarane) 類三萜皂草甙。  参蘆含大量的草酸鈣。草酸鈣能與胃中的鹽酸化合而生成草酸。草酸有催吐作用, 能使人惡心嘔吐。因此蘆頭不能當人参用。人參的偽品：華山參外形象人參, 分佈在陝西, 山西, 河南等地 。此藥性熱有毒。雖有藥效如溫中 安神定咳喘, 治虛寒腹瀉, 但用量甚小, 煎湯用0.3~0.9 g, 若以 l g以上煎服即易中毒, 中毒症狀主要為阿托品 樣作用。臨床症狀在初期會有口 乾舌燥, 吞嚥困難, 興奮, 幻覺, 皮膚潮紅無汗, 瞳孔散大及嘔吐, 眩暈, 狂躁, 瞻 妄等 症狀。晚期會有呼吸慢, 體溫升高但手腳發冷﹐ 全身抽搐, 昏迷, 甚至死亡發生。紅参是人參的栽培品 (圓參)經蒸制後的干燥根。秋季採挖, 洗淨, 蒸制後, 乾燥而成的。Also see ci wu jia （incorrectly called Siberian Ginseng)Also see American Ginseng.[n] Bibliography on request.
