It is high in oxalic acid that can cause the forming of stones of oxalates and damage the kidneys and can cause pain in joints and in vulva area.It also possesses trypsin inhibiting effect and it can hinder the digestion of protein.A study on New Guinea children death caused by enteritis necroticans related to sweet potato consumption and pork consumption has been reported. There are also a few cases of enteritis necroticans reported in America.Another study shows that certain group of New Guinea men were shorter compared to other groups with the same calorie intake and their main staple was sweet potatoes.Sweet potatoes can also cause the inhibition of the enzyme that kills malaria amoebas and can cause dormant malaria amoebas to flare up. It may also weaken the defense against malaria; so the chances to get malaria become higher.Enteritis necroticans is rarely reported in developed countries. The disease is likely to be under diagnosed.
