There 
            are many fake merchandise in the market. The fake birds' nest are made

            material. Many so called "blood birds' nests" are dyed with red dye

Do not use in case of infection.

市上假燕窩很多。有用豬皮，塑膠，海草做成的。不少 紅色
            假血燕是染色的。
如有濕熱感染忌用燕窩。



　
*Note: 
        Contrary to popular belief that birds' nest is cool, it is slightly warm. 
        None of the Chinese 
        herb classics mentioned it is cool. Some of them mentioned it is warm. According 
        to the author' experience, it is slightly warm.
 
Tryptophan: 
        is an essential amino acid, C11H12N2O2, 
        formed from proteins during digestion by the action of proteolytic enzymes 
        (an enzyme for digesting protein). It is necessary for normal growth 
        and development and is the precursor of several substances, including serotonin 
        and niacin. (Answers.com)
