The damage is caused by Abeta (beta-amyloid) which is a starch-like kind of protein. Alzheimer's disease can be classified as early onset and late onset Alzheimer's disease. Usually the genetic type of Alzheimer's disease starts early, in patients from 30 to 60 years of age, whereas the late onset disease shows up late in life. Abeta is one of the antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system. These antimicrobial peptides defend against invading bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Abeta gets triggered when there is a chronic infection, such as gum infection, Epstein-Barre , and especially yeast infection. That is because Abeta is especially effective in inhibiting Candida Albicans, the fungus that causes yeast infection. Candida Albicans can flair up when a person consumes too much sugar or uses certain antibiotics that can kill or inhibit Escherichia coli, a yeast fighting bacteria of the intestine, thus causing the yeast to be become overpopulated. Persons with diabetes may be susceptible to Alzheimer's because of their tendency to get yeast infections due to high levels of blood sugar. When Abeta is triggered, this antimicrobial peptide can get trapped in the brain. This happens because of a blood brain barrier dysfunction that causes the fluid in the brain not draining out normally or not filtering out harmful matter entering the brain normally. The Abeta thus gets trapped in the brain and causes damage to the dendrites of the nerve cells of the brain. The damaged dendrites break off, clump together, and form plaques in the brain. The plaques can be seen in special MRI tests and are signs of damaged brain cells. http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih2/addiction/guide/lesson2-1.htm Below is a report case report on immunization with Abeta. Neuropathology of human Alzheimer disease after immunization with amyloid-beta peptide: a case report. Nicoll JA , Wilkinson D , Holmes C , Steart P , Markham H , Weller RO . Division of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK. J.Nicoll@soton.ac.uk Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Immunization with Abeta in a transgenic mouse model of AD reduces both age-related accumulation of Abeta in the brain and associated cognitive impairment. Here we present the first analysis of human neuropathology after immunization with Abeta (AN-1792). Comparison with unimmunized cases of AD (n = 7) revealed the following unusual features in the immunized case, despite diagnostic neuropathological features of AD: (i) there were extensive areas of neocortex with very few Abeta plaques; (ii) those areas of cortex that were devoid of Abeta plaques contained densities of tangles, neuropil threads and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) similar to unimmunized AD, but lacked plaque-associated dystrophic neurites and astrocyte clusters; (iii) in some regions devoid of plaques, Abeta-immunoreactivity was associated with microglia; (iv) T-lymphocyte meningoencephalitis was present; and (v) cerebral white matter showed infiltration by macrophages. Findings (i)-(iii) strongly resemble the changes seen after Abeta immunotherapy in mouse models of AD and suggest that the immune response generated against the peptide elicited clearance of Abeta plaques in this patient. The T-lymphocyte meningoencephalitis is likely to correspond to the side effect seen in some other patients who received AN-1792 (refs. 7-9). PMID: 12640446 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Explanation of the abov e treatise by Joe Hing Kwok Chu : Amyloid-beta peptide: is an antimicrobial peptide. Beta-amyloid is a starch - like protein that can help eliminate infection but can also damage the healthy brain cells. Aβ (beta- amyloid) plays a key role in the cause of Alzheimer's disease. Aβ can adjust itself to a variety of environmental stressors, and is able to induce pro-inflammatory activities.[2] Immunization with an Abeta vaccine in mice that were genetically induced with Alzheimer's disease, reduces the age-related accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain and associated cognitive impairment. The researchers immuniz ed a human patient with Abeta vaccine, using the drug called AN-1792. ( AN-1792 was developed to stimulate the immune system to "recognize" and attack the amyloid plaques that are a characteristic of Alzheimer brain abnormality). Compared to 7 un-immunized cases, it was found that despite the diagnostic sickness of the nerves/brain of Alzheimer's disease: there were extensive areas of the top layer of the brain hemispheres ( neocortex ) with very few Abeta (beta-amyloid) plaques ; those areas of cortex that were devoid of Abeta plaques contained densities of tangles , neuropil threads and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) similar to unimmunized AD, but lacked plaque-associated dystrophic (degenerated) neurites and astrocyte clusters ; in some regions devoid of plaques, Abeta-immunoreactivity was associated with microglia ; T-lymphocyte meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and the membrane) was present; and cerebral white matter showed infiltration by macrophages (large white cells that defend against bacteria and other foreign matters). Findings (1)-(3) strongly resemble the changes seen after Abeta immunotherapy in mouse models of AD and suggest that the immune response generated against the peptide elicited clearance of Abeta plaques in this patient. The T-lymphocyte meningoencephalitis is likely to correspond to the side effect seen in some other patients who received AN-1792. Neuropil is the nervous tissue consisting of a fibrous network of nonmyelinated nerve fibers; gray matter with few nerve cell bodies; usually a region of synapses between axons and dendrites.

It is a disease of small blood vessels in the brain in which deposits of amyloid protein in the vessel walls may lead to stroke , brain hemorrhage, or dementia . Amyloid protein resembles a starch and is deposited in tissues during the course of certain chronic diseases.

(click here to go back ) Neurites: Any projection from the cell body of a neuron can be referred to as a neurite. This projection can be either an axon or a dendrite . The term is frequently used when speaking of immature or developing neurons, especially of cells in culture , because it can be difficult to tell axons from dendrites in that situation.

Chinese herb qian ceng ta; and 2. common herb Spanish sage A P ot ential Treatmen t for Alzheimer's disease (from Shanghai) Stimulating β2-adrenergic receptor can increase the activity of γ-secretase and can cause the increase of the production of beta-amyloid protein (Aβ). This discovery shows a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease, and therefore γ-secretase is a potential target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. [1] Another potential Treatment for Alzheimer's disease is about to achieve a homeostasis of iron in the brain. Patients with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease show a dramatic increase in their brain iron content. Benzodiazepine use is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
