Edited by: Joe Hing Kwok Chu Dengue fever is an acute infectious disease caused by a virus and transmitted by the Aedes or yellow fever mosquito. It usually occurs in tropical or subtropical climates. Symptoms include headache, fever, and intense joint pain. The symptoms usually last about a week. Fever usually subsides after 2 to 4 days then after 1 to 2 days it rises again, and followed by a generalized rash. The hemorrhagic form of the disease, when serious, can be fatal. The disease spreads rapidly. The mortality is low. There is no specific treatment. Traditional Western therapy includes supportive therapy and centers on management of fluid and electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of shock, treatment of coagulation disorders and therapy for secondary bacterial infection. In traditional Chinese medicine, dengue fever can be considered and treated as wen (warm) sickness. Using traditional Chinese diagnostics and herb therapy, the results are better than using modern drug therapy.
