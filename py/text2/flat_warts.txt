They have a certain life span. Even when untreated, they may disappear after a few years. They are found on face and arms. Usually treatment is not necessary unless they are in locations that are deemed unsightly or unless they are painful (like ordinary warts on the bottom of the feet). One option for treatment includes applying over-the-counter medications, usually various mixtures of salicylic acid and lactic acid. These medications typically are topically applied daily for several weeks. When the skin is sensitive or the salicyclic acid is in high concentration, salicylic acid usually causes skin irritation or burns. The result of treatment with over-the-counter medications is not usually satisfactory because burning the outer layer of the skin does not usually get rid of flat warts. Other options for treatment focus on removal of the wart by various methods, including surgery, freezing (cryotherapy), burning (electrocautery) or laser treatments.immunotherapy is yet another approach. Various topical drugs can be applied to the warts, to cause a localized allergic reaction, thus getting rid of them. Sometimes these methods may work, but other times they do not. Yet another treatment which is often effective is the Chinese Herb Therapy described below. Chinese Herb Therapy Method I . Prescription: Make 20 ~30% of alcohol extract of bu gu zhi tincture. Apply externally daily for a few weeks or until they disappear. Internal Formula: Name of Formula: Flat Wart Tea C omposition: ku shen 15 g ¡A ba qia 20 g ¡A tu fu ling 30 g ¡A di fu zi 12 g . Grind into coarse powder and put into a thermos bottle. Pour in boiling water. Let stand for 20 minutes and use as tea. One package per day. Usually it takes about 20 days. Contra-indication: not to use in case of pixu (spleen deficient) . ¡@ Method II. Another therapy method: Warts of palms of the feet: use shan dou gen, ban lan gen 60 g each. Add water 3000 c.c. Bring to boil for 10 minutes. Cool to bath water temperature. Soak feet for 30 minutes, once a day. For larger once use moxibustion for 10 minutes each time. Treated 54 patients. The smallest amount of warts on the feet is 8 and largest number is 27. Healed: 43. Ineffective: 11. After healing, use another 3 to 9 doses. ¡i3¡j ¡@ Method III. Another method is to use gray, heavy-duty, fabric-backed duct tape on the wart. Apply a small piece of the duct tape over the wart. If the tape falls off, apply a new piece. Wear the tape for 6 days then remove and clean and file the wart with emery board. Re-apply the tape again. Continue the therapy for maximum of 2 months or till the wart disappear. The tape should be the heavy duty type which contains rubber because rubber can stimulate the immune system. This works better with children who have stronger immune system than older adults.
