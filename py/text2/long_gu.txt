In this study, in vivo characterization of the sedative activities of Fossilia Mastodi OSSIS was performed in order to obtain basic information for the development of a putative natural sedative. The 80% methanol extract of Fossilia Mastodi OSSIS given per os at a dose of 3 g/kg in mice showed anxiolysis, potentiation of pentobarbital sleeping time, reduced locomotor activity, and anticonvulsive activity. Fossilia elicited GABA(A) receptor-mediated anxiolysis. The data obtained suggest that the 80% methanol extract of Fossilia Mastodi OSSIS contains some biologically active principles with sedative activity.
