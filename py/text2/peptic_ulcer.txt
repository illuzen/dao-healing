LAH Pep tic Ulcer 胃十二指腸潰 (in English and Chinese 中英文) Edited by: Joe Hing Kwok Chu 按此看中文 To read the whole article, please click on the blue or pink underlined links, as you read along. Symptoms: a burning sensation in the upper abdomen or chest after meals or when the stomach is empty. For more information see under the item: Chinese herb therapy These symptoms of peptic ulcers can also exist in: GERD ( gastro-esophageal reflux disease), Non-ulcer dyspepsia ( chronic dyspepsia without the presence of ulcers or functional dyspepsia), gallbladder disease, liver disease other disorders. Causes: Most peptic ulcers are caused by: Primary cause: Helicobacter pylori , a bacteria Inducing causes: system suppressed by stress, and/or consumption of alcohol, tobacco, aspirin, corticosteroids, coffee and spicy food, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) Secondary causes: tumors on the pancreas and duodenum . Most people who have the infection are without symptoms, but long-term emotional stress and/or long-term consumption of aggravating substances can disrupt the protective mucus linings of the stomach and duodenum. This allows the strong digestive acid to directly contact the tissues of the stomach or duodenum and triggers ulcers. H. pylori diagnosis: 1. Tissue test: during Endoscopy small bits of tissue are removed and tested for H. pylori . 2. Breathing test: patients are given urea orally, and an enzyme of the H. pylori breaks down the urea into carbon dioxide, which is exhaled and can be measured. 3. Antibody test: antibodies are formed when the patient is infected with H. pylori . If in the antibody is present, it means the patient is either currently or previously infected. This test may not determine whether the patients infection is active. Western Treatments include : (1) using antibiotics: H. pylori is difficult to eradicate because it burrows deep into the mucus layers. Usually several antibiotics are used in combination, such as metronidazole (Flagyl), tetracycline (Achromycin), clarithromycin (Biaxin), or amoxicillin (Amoxil). The side effects of antibiotic use include disruption of the balance of the beneficial bacteria ( Escherichia coli, also known as E. coli ). Low level of E. coli can promote the growth of yeast in the digestive tract, causing a yeast infection . Bismuth subsalicylate (an active ingredient of Pepto-Bismol) also provides the effect of antibiotics It may help to inhibit or eradicate the bacteria but it may also create the side effects like antibiotics. (2) using anti-acid: alkaline include sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide H2 antagonists include Cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid Pulvules), and ranitidine ( Zantac ) proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a group of prescription medications that prevent the release of stomach acid by inhibiting the enzyme in the wall of the stomach that produces acid. PPIs include omeprazole sodium (Losec), esomeprazole sodium (Nexium), lansoprazole sodium (Zoton), pantoprazole sodium (Protium), and rabeprazole sodium (Pariet). Common side effects of PPIs include diarrhea, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain and headache. In rare instances, side effects can also include allergic reactions, itchiness, dizziness, swollen ankles, muscle and joint pain, blurred vision, depression, dry mouth, osteoporosis and hip fracture. Long-term inhibition of digestive acid using acid neutralizers or PPIs can promote bacteria growth in the stomach and also can may interfere with calcium absorption because of insufficiency of hydrochloride acid but they also may reduce bone resorption [2] through inhibition of osteoclastic vacuolar proton pumps . See here See this study that shows that long-term proton pump inhibitors (PPI) therapy, particularly at high doses, is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. [2] Use proton pump inhibitors with care in case of pregnancy or with liver or kidney problems. (3) Using De-Glycerrhizinated Licorice (DGL) (Caved-S) Therapy: Caved-S is manufactured by various pharmaceutical companies. One of its main ingredients is the common Chinese herb gan cao ( licorice , Glycyrrhiza glabra L) but has been deglycerrhinated, to eliminate the side effects of the glycyrrhizinic acid in the licorice which possess the effect of mineralcortical hormone . See a study of : a two year comparison between Caved-S and cimetidine treatment in the prevention of symptomatic gastric ulcer recurrence. Side effects of Caved-S: can include calcium depletion through excretion (both urine and stool) caused by aluminum hydroxide, one of the components of Caved-S. Aluminum hydroxide also depletes phosphorus in the normal body, and long-term use can bring phosphorus down to an unnaturally low level which may cause adverse effect on memory.. Chinese herb therapy includes: ( click to go back to top) I. Ulcers of the duodenum with internal heat and fullness syndrome: burning sensation in the upper abdomen or inside chest area. Usually these symptoms are common in ulcers of the duodenum which usually occur in younger persons of 20 to 30 years old. The stomach acid secretion can be normal or increased and usually accompanied with erosive (hemorrhagic) gastritis (inflammation of the lining of the stomach). Therapy: huang lian jie du tang combine with shao yao gan cao tang is commonly used. Huang lian jie du tang is also effective for bleeding of the ulcers and has been proven it can inhibit Helicobactor pylori . II. Ulcers of the stomach with liver and spleen inharmony or with yang deficient (yangxu) condition: mostly occur among persons of 40 to 50 years old. The stomach acid secretion can be normal or decreased and along with atrophic gastritis. Symptoms include upper abdomen achiness after meals or when stomach is empty. Sometimes it does not have any pain but only with the sensation of fullness in the upper abdomen. Therapy: A n zhong san is commonly used but during bleeding huang lian jie du tang with adjustment can be use temporarily. For those with yang deficient . warming formulae like an zhong san , ren shen tang or liu jun zi tang are commonly used. The rate of success using an zhong san has been about 75%. It is about as effective as H2 antagonists . In case of liver qi stagnation , formulae like dan zhi xiao yao san, chai hu shu gan tang are commonly used. The long term maintenance usage of the formula chai hu gui zhi tang has been proven for preventing the recurring of the peptic ulcers . It has been proven that chai hu gui zhi tang can inhibit pepsin and stomach acid secretion. It also can enhance the secretion of stomach mucus and promote blood circulation in the stomach and enhance the protection of the stomach. Li iver qi stagnation can lead to the inflammatory pathological changes in gastric mucosa. The reduction of concentration of free mucus, PGE2 in gastric juice and SOD , NO in gastric mucosa were one of the main pathophysiological foundations of the gastric mucosa inflammation caused by liver-qi stagnation . The herbs of relieving depressed liver can prevent and treat stomach ailment that caused by liver-qi stagnation , the inner mechanism was associated with its regulation to the aforesaid indices and its reinforce to the protective function of gastric mucosa. 【1】 Note: Endoscopy : Using an instrument (endoscope) to look into the colon, bladder, aesophagus or stomach. ( Click to go back) H2 antagonists inhibit histamine action on the H2 receptor of the gastric parietal cell and slow down the secrete hydrochloric acid which digests protein. ( Click to go back) Caved-S main ingredients: Aluminum hydroxide 100 mg Sodium bicarbonate 100 mg Bismuth subnitrate 100 mg Magnesium carbonate 200 mg Deglycyrrhinated gan cao 300 mg ( Click to go back) mineralcortical hormone is a hormone secreted by the adrenocortex, the outer parts of the adrenal glands that sit on top the kidneys. When this hormone is high, the body retains sodium and expels potassium. As early as 1946 gan cao extract showed the characteristics of mineralcorticoid. Glycyrrhiza ( gan cao ) is metabolically converted to glycyrrhetic acid (GA). GA, when incubated in-vitro with adrenal gland cells increases production of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a precursor of androstenedione, testosterone and estrogen. ( Click to go back) One of the digestive juices secreted by the stomach is hydrochloride acid which digests protein. The stomach and duodenum have linings that protect themselves from being digested. If ulcers are formed the acid gets into contact with the stomach or duodenum tissues then it will cause injuries and pain. ( Click to go back) Pepsin is a digestive enzyme found in gastric juice that helps the breakdown of protein to peptides (digested protein). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzymatic antioxidant that removes the potentially toxic superoxide ion (O 2- ) by dismutating it to O 2 and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Nitric oxide (NO): The peptic mucus produces nitric oxide (NO) which relaxes the wall of the blood vessels and promotes blood flow and help heal the peptic ulcers. Bone resorption: O steoclasts are multi-nucleated cells that perform bone resorption. Bone resorption Is the process of removing bone tissue by removing the bone's mineralized matrix. Osteoclasts play a key role in bone-remodelling, like in forming canals and cavities, changing sizes and structure as demand arises. ( Click to go back) Nonsteroida l anti-inflammatory drugs: like ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Rufen), diclofenac (Voltaren), etodolac (Lodine), flurbiprofen (Ansaid), ketorolac (Toradol), nabumetone (Relafen), naproxen (Naprosyn); naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprelan); and oxaprozin (Daypro). ( Click to go back) Zollinger-Ellison syndrome : Tumors of the pancreas and duodenum may cause the excess production of gastrin, a hormone secreted by glands in the mucous membrane of the stomach which in turn causes the overproduction of stomach acid. ( Click to go back) Secondary causes : the sickness caused by other illnesses. ( Click to go back) D yspepsia: painful and disturbed digestion usually with nausea, vomiting, heartburn and bloating.
