Note: After Zhang Zi He, a Chinese doctor of the Yuan dynasty, declared that all cases of mood disorder were caused by phlegm, most of the medical texts from that time to the present day follow this hypothesis. Studies using a large number of patients have been done under controlled environments and the results show that treatment using phlegm removing methods failed to solve the problem. Warning: The formula, long dan xie gan tang, can be toxic to the kidneys because of the herb mu tong . There are different varieties of mu tong in the market. Before the Qing dynasty , however, it was not toxic because mu tong was derived from either the plant of Akebia guinata or the plant Akebia lobata . Today, ninety five percent of mu tong used in China is from the stem of Aristolochia debilis , called guan mu tong ( 關 木 通 ), a toxic plant usually grown in the northeastern province s of China , formally called Manchuria . Only rarely in a few localities in China, is mu tong obtained from Akebia guinata or Akebia lobata being used. Many cases of kidney failure have been reported in the China from taking this formula. Today in China , all manufactured f ormulae that contain guan mu tong ( aristolochia debilis ) are being banned because of the toxicity to the kidneys. If you use this formula, make sure you are not using guan mu tong . Use chuan mu tong or huai tong , or bai mu tong instead.
