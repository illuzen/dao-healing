Clinical symptoms include: exhaustion fatigue impotence loss of appetite nausea weakness weight loss ; as the conditions become serious the follow may occur: Edema and ascites caused by the inability to make the protein albumin. Bruising and bleeding. caused by the inability or slowing down in production of the factors needed for blood clotting. Bruises or bleeding occur easily. Jaundice caused by the inability to absorb enough bilirubin. Itching caused by bile products deposited in the skin. Gallstones caused by the inability of the bile to reach the gallbladder. Toxins in the blood or brain caused by the inability to remove toxins from the blood.. The toxins decrease mental function, like forgetfulness, trouble concentrating, changes in sleep habits and cause personality changes, and may cause coma, and even death. Sensitivity to medication caused by the inability to filter medications and toxins from the blood; so they act longer than normal and build up in the body and cause more sensitivity to drugs and their side effects. Portal hypertension caused by the inability to have the normal flow of blood through the portal vein , which increases the pressure inside it (portal hypertension) and causes spleen enlargement. Varices (varicose veins) caused by the inability of the portal vein to carry the normal amount of blood. Blood from the intestines and spleen backs up into blood vessels in the stomach and esophagus and causes these blood vessels to be enlarged. and causes the wall and the blood vessels to become thin and carry high pressure,. Because of the high pressure and the thin walls, they are likely to burst. If they burst, the result can be bleeding to death unless the patient gets immediate medical attention. Kidney failure: the portal hypertension damages the kidney tubule. abdominal infection: the ascites can become infected with bacteria from the intestine.
