After that the body releases catechol-O-methyl transferase, an enzyme involved in metabolizing (degrading) catecholamines (like epinephrine, nor-epinephrine, and dopamine) Another issue is pituitary problem. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may cause impairment of pituitary hormone secretion , which may contribute to long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological disability. Therefore, evaluation of pituitary hormone secretion, including growth hormone, should be included in the long-term follow-up of all TBI patients so that adequate hormone replacement therapy may be administered.[2] Hypopituitarism has recently been reported to occur in 3580% of patients in rehabilitation following head injury. Hypopituitarism causes adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency accounts for 3050% of these cases.[1] Approximately 50% of patients with moderate or severe TBI have at least transient adrenal insufficiency which may be the result of pituitary insufficiency. When cortisol , epinephrine, nor-epinephrine, and dopamine become insufficient, the patients may experience depression , cold extremities, r estless leg syndrome , lack of libido , urinary dysfunction, and memory deficit . When cortisol , thyroid hormone, epinephrine, nor-epinephrine, and dopamine become insufficient, may cause syndrome of shenyangxu and liver qi stagnation . Blood clots in the brain can cause long term effect on movements, eye sight, hearing, balance. It should be addressed early.. If syndrome of shenyangxu occurs herb formulae can be use and also see this page . 創傷性腦損傷可能影響垂體激素的分泌，而致長期認知和心理障礙。因此，垂體激素的分泌，包括生長激素之核定，應包括在長期隨訪所有創傷性腦損傷患者的以便充分施用激素替代療法[2]。 在創傷性腦損傷的早期階段，交感神經系統變得興奮是由於腎上腺素和去甲腎上腺素的增加。過後，身體會釋放兒茶酚-O -甲基轉移酶 （降解兒茶酚胺的酶）。 兒茶酚胺包括腎上腺素，去甲腎上腺素和多巴胺。 最近有報導在頭部受傷康復之後垂體功能低下，30-50％患者發生腎上腺皮質功能不全。 [1] 約50 ％的患者有中度或重度腦外傷至少有短暫的腎上腺皮質功能不全，可能是垂體功能不足所致的。 當皮質醇，腎上腺素，去甲腎上腺素和多巴胺變得不足， 會導致 腎陽虛 的症狀。患者可能出現 肝氣鬱結 ，四肢發冷， 不安腿 ，性慾低下和記憶不良。 腦部瘀血可導致長期慢性不良影響如癱瘓，視覺，聽覺，平衡，記憶不良。瘀血應該早期處理。 Ventricle edema [1] Oxford Journals Medicine BJA Volume 96, Issue 1 Pp. 72-76 [2] J Neurotrauma. 2004 Jun;21(6):685-96.
