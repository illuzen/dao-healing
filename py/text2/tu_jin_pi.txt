Medical functions:[1] 藥理﹕[1] An anti-fungal effect: We used 0.2cm plaster-like ringworm colonies transplanted in Sabourand's dextrose agar. After 3 weeks, we then cut diameter <0.2cm colonies and inoculated them in liquid medium of 40% pseudolaric and control medium, each propagated in 3 tubes for 25 ℃ nurtured in 2h, and then ultra thinly sliced into sections with conventional method. Examining them with the electron microscope, it showed a strong anti-fungal effect of pseudolaric, the degree of cell damage in the herb concentration and flow rate of the same case the duration of herb action related. If the fungus was fully exposed to the herb concentration, 100% of cells would be killed .Comparing the effect tu jing pi and amphotericin B antifungal agents on Candida albicans:the same effects are that the cytoplasm are electronic thin area, cell membrane integrity, and fold into the cytoplasm. The differences are that fungal cell structures have changed, organelles disappear, the apparent shrinkage of the cell membrane, and showed a diverticulum-like fold into the cell header, mitochondrial structural degeneration and even disappear, The main components of antifungal tu jing of pi are tu jing formic acid, the tu jing acid tu jing, propionic acid. Effect of tu jing acetic acid glycosides on cultured human liver cells: human hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721 were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 30% fetal calf serum medium, the growth of dense monolayer of cells made from suspension liquid equal the number of cells seeded in culture flasks, incubated at 37 ℃ 2d for experimental control observation of human diploid cell 2BS.tu jing acid glycosides made of injectiones (20mg/ml) with 3.5% polysorbate 80 experiments using the above medium dubbed the concentration of acetic acid glycosides tu jing 10ug, droperidol 5 μg,, and 265ug/ml3 group were added to the flasks ready to cells continue to cultivate. Observed 24h after dosing; cultured 6d; dosing and 48h after counting total cell number and the number of dead cells, obtained the herbs on the cell-killing rate. The results showed that tumor cell morphology compared with the control group, the tu jing acid glycosides 10 and 5ug/ml two groups, the majority of cells rounded, membrane thickening shrinkage and shedding was suspended like only see the growth of a small number of adherent cells ; group 10,5,2.5 ug/ml3 the cell growth with different degree of inhibition, of 10ug/ml role d6, significantly inhibited cell proliferation, the inhibition rates were 56.7%, 55.1% and 56.2 proliferation inhibition rate was 96.9%%, 10ug/ml group d6; the protein content of each group of cell lysate with acid glucoside concentration intu jing increase the protein content of the inhibition rate increased when thetu jing acid glycosides dose for 10ug/ml The inhibition rate of 64.54%; acid glucoside concentration intu jing 10,5 and 2.5ug/ml, the cell killing rate were 42.9%, 39.3% and 29.4% in the control group only 8.3% of cell death. Antifertility effect: anti-early pregnancy the role of adult female rats, weighing 200 ± SD22g, adult rats, body weight 330 ± 40g, free access to water and eat light 7:00 am a 7:00 pm, male and female 2:1 co-cage daily 8:00 vaginal smear to be found in the sperm pregnancy dl, n = 10 pregnant rats, pregnancy, d7, 8,9 ig, administration, medicine d6 anatomy, where a normal one or more fetuses as pregnancy animals. Pregnancy, hamsters, tu jing formic acid 60mg/kg with the control group compared to the very obvious role of anti-early pregnancy (P <0.01 =, while the tu jing acid 20-40mg/kg obvious role of anti-early pregnancy (P <0.05 or P <0.01 =. the tu jing acid 30-40mg/kgqdx3d to rabbit sc and iv solution, anti-early pregnancy effect is better than the ig suspension 40mg/kgqdx3d tu jing acetic acid to pregnant dogs during pregnancy 14d ig suspension after herb withdrawal of d6 Poujian fetus, 1mg/kqqdx3d, four dogs, two early pregnancy termination of intrauterine inner tube, Aberdeen, all died, the other two dogs have four live births, dose 5mg/kgqdx3d, 4 dogs all termination of early pregnancy, and fetal death. two dogs, a single ig suspension 20-30mg/kg fetuses all died. role of tu jing acetate anti-early pregnancy may first damage the decidual part of the mother's, and decidua necrosis is not due to decline of progesterone. Experiments showed that exogenous progesterone can not stop the anti-early pregnancy of tu jing acetate. 1.抗真菌作用 取0.2cm的石膏樣癬菌菌落移種於Sabourand氏葡萄糖瓊脂培養基上，3wk後切直徑<0.2cm的菌落接種於40%土荊皮藥液培養基及對照培養基中，各接種3管，25℃培育2h，然後按常規處理制成超薄切片，用電鏡觀察，土荊皮有很強的抗真菌作用，細胞損傷程度在藥物濃度與流量相同情況下與藥物作用時間長短有關，若真菌充分暴露，藥物濃度足夠時，有100%殺滅細胞作用。土荊皮與二性霉素B等抗真菌劑對白色念珠菌的作用相比較，其相同點為細胞漿內均有電子薄區，細胞膜完整，並反折入胞漿內。不同點在於土荊皮作用的真菌細胞結構變性，細胞器消失，細胞膜明顯皺縮，並呈憩室樣反折入胞頭，線粒體結構亦變性乃至消失。土荊皮中抗真菌的主要成分為土荊甲酸、土荊乙酸、土荊丙酸。 2.土荊乙酸甙對培養人體肝癌細胞的作用 以人體肝癌細胞株SMMC-7721培養於含30%小牛血清的RPMI-1640培養液，將生長茂密的單層細胞制成懸浮液液，以相等的細胞數接種於培養瓶，於37℃培養2d供實驗用，以人體兩倍體細胞2BS作對照觀察。土荊乙酸甙用3.5% 聚山梨酯-80 制成針劑(20mg/ml)，實驗時用上述培養液配成土荊乙酸甙濃度為10ug、5ug和265ug/ml3組，分別加入准備好細胞的培養瓶中繼續培養。觀察加藥後24h；培養6d;加藥後48h等，計數各組總細胞數和死細胞數，求出藥物對細胞的殺傷率。結果表明，瘤細胞形態與對照組比較，土荊乙酸甙10和5ug/ml的兩組，大部分細胞變圓，胞膜變厚皺縮，且均脫落呈懸浮狀，僅見少數細胞貼壁生長；10、5、2.5ug/ml3組對肝癌細胞生長有不同程度抑制作用，10ug/ml作用d6起，對細胞增殖有較明顯的抑制作用，其抑制率分別為56.7%、55.1%和56.2%，10ug/ml組d6時增殖抑制率達96.9%；各組細胞凍融液的蛋白質含量隨土荊乙酸甙濃度遞增而蛋白質含量的抑制率增高，當土荊乙酸甙劑量為10ug/ml時，其抑制率達64.54%；土荊乙酸甙濃度為10、5和2.5ug/ml時，對細胞殺傷率分別為42.9%、39.3%和29.4%，對照組僅8.3%細胞死亡。 3.抗生育作用 抗早孕作用: 成年雌大鼠，體重200±SD22g，成年大鼠，體重330±40g，自由飲水和進食，光照 7：00am一7：00pm，雌雄按2：1合籠，每日8：00 陰道涂片，以查到精子為妊娠dl，孕鼠每組10隻，於妊娠d7，8，9 ig給藥，藥後d6解剖，凡有一個或一個以上正常胎仔作為妊娠動物。對於妊娠倉鼠，土荊甲酸60mg/kg與對照組相比較有非常明顯的抗早孕作用(P＜0.01＝，而土荊乙酸20-40mg/kg有明顯的抗早孕作用(P＜0.05或P＜0.01＝。土荊乙酸30-40mg/kgqdx3d給兔sc和iv溶液，抗早孕效果較ig混懸液40mg/kgqdx3d為好。土荊乙酸給孕狗，於妊娠14d內ig混懸液，停藥後d6剖檢胎仔，1mg/kqqdx3d，4隻狗中有2隻早孕終止，宮腔內胎仔全部死亡，另2隻狗各有4個活胎，劑量5mg/kgqdx3d，4隻狗的早孕全部終止，胎仔死亡。給2隻狗單次ig混懸液20-30mg/kg，胎仔亦全部死亡。土荊乙酸的抗早孕作用可能首先損傷母體的蛻膜部分，且蛻膜壞死不是由於孕酮下降的緣故，實驗表明外源性孕酮不能對抗其抗早孕作用。 Actions & Indications: 主治﹕ arrest itchiness, for skin fungal infection. 殺蟲，止癢。用於疥癬瘙癢 。 Chemical ingredients:[1] 化學成份﹕[1] Bark of root contains: 根皮含 pseudolaric acid）A、B、C、D、E 土荊皮酸（pseudolaric acid）A、B、C、D、E demethylpseudolaric acid B 土荊皮酸C2即是去甲基土荊皮酸B pseudolaric acid A-β-D-glucoside 荊皮酸A-β-D-葡葡糖甙 pseudolarifuroic 金錢松呋喃酸 betulinic acid 白樺脂酸 β-sitosterol β-谷甾醇 β-sitosterol-β-D-glucoside β-谷甾醇-β-D-葡萄糖甙 Seed contain: 種子含: pseudolarolide E, H 土 荊皮內酯 E、H pseudolarolide A, B, C, D. 土荊皮內酯 A、B、C、D、 In the tree trunk: 樹輪中含 lead, iron, calcium, manganese, zinc and five kinds of elements. 鉛、鐵、鈣、錳、鋅五種元素。 Dosage: 用量﹕ external use with appropriate amount.
