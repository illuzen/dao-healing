The symptoms of damp heat might suggest bacteria infection. One of the following formulae can be use: (1) Name of Formula: long dan xie gan tang (Source: Yi Zong Jin Jian ) Ingredients: long dan cao 6 g, huang qin 9 g, shan zhi zi 9 g, ze xie 12 g, mu tong 9 g, che qian zi 9 g, chai hu 6 g, gan cao 6 g, sheng di 9 g. Boil with water. One package a day. Make into two serving. Stop taking when symptoms subside. Do not take it for long time. Warning: This formula can be toxic to the kidneys because of the herb mu tong. There are different varieties of mu tong in the market. Before the Qing dynasty , however, it was not toxic because mu tong was derived from either the plant of Akebia guinata or the plant Akebia lobata . Today, ninety five percent of mu tong (guan mu tong 關木通 ) used in China is from the stem of Aristolochia debilis , a toxic plant usually grown in the northeastern province s of China , formally called Manchuria . Only rarely in a few localities in China, is mu tong obtained from Akebia guinata or Akebia lobata being used. Many cases of kidney failure have been reported in the China from taking this formula.Today in China , all manufactured f ormulae that contain guan mu tong ( aristolochia debilis ) are being banned because of the toxicity to the kidneys. A recent study shows that all herb tested in American listed as Akebia are actually Aristolochia debilis If you use this formula, make sure you are not using guan mu tong. Use chuan chuan mu tong or huai tong , or bai mu tong tong instead. Manufactured formulae that contain guan mu tong are being banned in China because of the toxicity to the kidneys.
