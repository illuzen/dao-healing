During 1990 to 2001, the authors noted above treated 94 patients diagnosed with chronic renal failure. The results of the treatments using a combination of inosine intravenously and wen pi tang orally to lower their BUN and Scr (serum creatinine) were satisfactory. 1. Clinical information 1.1 Selection of patients for the study The 94 patients were all inpatients of their hospital. Among them were 62 males and 32 female, ages 23 to 62. According to the 5th edition of the medical training book "Internal Medicine" (內 科學) , patients were diagnosed with these specific conditions: 66 patients had chronic nephritis, 16 had pyelonephritis, 8 had kidney arteriolar sclerosis, and 4 were experiencing decreased kidney function due to diabetes. All patients experienced nausea, lack of appetite, limb fullness, tiredness and lack of energy, lower limb edema with resulting lack of urine, pale tongue with thin white fur, and deep and weak pulse. The TCM diagnosis is shenyangxu (kidney yang deficient) with pixu (spleen deficient) . 1.2 Group divisions: The patients were divided into 3 groups: Modern (Western) & traditional Chinese medicine combination group Traditional Chinese medicine group Modern (Western) medicine group There was no statistical significance in the groups' differences in ages, sexes, Bun and Scr. Table I Comparison of the 3 Groups Group N Ages male: female BUN average value （ mmo1） Scr average value （μ mo1/L） Modern (Western) & TCM combination group 34 24-60 11 : 6 20.5 427.5 Traditional Chinese medicine group 28 27-62 10 : 4 20.0 406.0 Modern (Western) medicine group 32 24-60 10 : 6 21.5 440.0 2. Therapy Method s : Modern (Western) medicine group: 1 g of Inosine with 10% of GS 250 to 500 ml IV application o nce a day for 30 days. Traditional Chinese medicine group: W en pi tang . When edema wa s serious , 10 grams bai mao gen was taken orally for 30 days . Combined therapy group: Intravenous application of Inosine and wen pi tang taken orally, for 30 days. 3. Result s : T he value of each patient's BUN and Scr was measured b efore and after treatment . When BUN lowered by ≧０ . ３ ６ µmol/L and at the same time the Scr lowered by ≧７０ µmol/L , then it was deemed effect ive . If one of the value s did not reach the designated value, it was deemed ineffective. The result s were as follow s : Table II The Comparison of the Result of different Therapies Group N effective not effective effectiveness（ ％） Modern (Western) & TCM combination group 34 28 ６ 82.0* Traditional Chinese medicine group 28 14 14 50.0 Modern (Western) medicine group 32 12 20 37.5 ＊P < 0.05 Note by Editor: Common Reference Ranges of Scr (serum creatinine): Male Adults: 62 -133 µmol/L (0.7 - 1.5 mg/dL) . Female Adult: 44 to 97 µmol/L ( 0.5-1. 1 mg/dl ) BUN (Blood urine nitrogen): Adults: 3 - 6.5 µmol/L (or 8-18 mg/dL) BUN (Blood urine nitrogen) test ; Urea is the metabolite of protein consumed. If the kidneys are not able to remove urea from the blood normally, the BUN (blood urine nitrogen) level increases. This means that the kidneys are not functioning properly. Factor that can increase BUN level: Heart failure Dehydration High protein diet Factors that can decrease BUN level: Liver disease or damage (urea is made in the liver) Second or third trimester pregnancy Drugs that can increase BUN measurements include: Allopurinol, Aminoglycosides, Amphotericin B, Bacitracin, Carbamazepine, Cephalosporins, Chloral hydrate, Cisplatin, Colistin, Furosemide, Gentamicin, Guanethidine, High-dose aspirin, Indomethacin, Methicillin, Methotrexate, Methyldopa, Neomycin, Penicillamine, Polymyxin B, Probenecid, Propranolol, Rifampin, Spironolactone, Tetracyclines, Thiazide diuretics, Triamterene, Vancomycin, Drugs that can decrease BUN, measurements include: Chloramphenicol, Streptomycin.
